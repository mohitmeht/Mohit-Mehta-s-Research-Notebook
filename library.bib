abstract = {Thermal runaway of lithium-ion cells is a complex process governed by heat production due to thermal decomposition reactions and heat transport within the cells. Exothermic characteristics are simulated for solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on anode of a Li-ion cell. As a pilot study preliminary to building thermal runaway mitigation system, exothermic SEI decomposition and formation reactions are included in thermo-electrochemical 1D model in addition to lithium insertion in multi-scale model of battery kinetics. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) simulations of negative electrode are used to parameterize and validate the model against experiments in literature. Simulations under constant and rising ambient temperature show the onset of runaway at temperatures around 400K.},

abstract = {A novel biocompatible film assembled by combining of graphene oxide (GO) and poly-l-lysine (PLL) for adhesion and electrochemical impedance detection of leukemia K562 cells was proposed. The biocompatible film showed an improved immobilization capacity for living cells and a good biocompatibility for preserving the activity of the immobilized living cells. The immobilized K562 cells on the biocompatible film-modified electrode can be directly monitored with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- as redox probes. A highly sensitive electrochemical impedance method for the detection of leukemia K562 cancer cells was developed. Under the optimized conditions, the increased electron-transfer resistance with a good correlation to the logarithmic value of concentration of K562 cells ranging from 102 to 107cellsmL-1, and with the detection limit of 30cellsmL-1 (S/N=3). Additionally, the proposed method was used to describe the viability of cells and to evaluate the effectiveness of antitumor drug Nilotinib on K562 cells. The obtained results of Nilotinib cytotoxicity are well agreed with those from WST-1 assays. Furthermore, the work demonstrates that a highly biocompatible film of PLL/GO assembled is also expected to be an appropriate matrix for the electrochemical investigation of adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis of other relevant mammalian cells which is not limited to adherent cells, and the study of cell-based biosensors. © 2012.},

@article{Jung2015,
abstract = {In this paper, a one-dimensional mathematical model for a non-aqueous lithium–oxygen battery is developed. Unlike previous models, in which all the depositions of the discharge product, lithium peroxide (Li2O2), onto carbon surfaces are treated as continuous solid films, the present work models the formation of Li2O2 as a discontinuous deposit layer. Moreover, the effect of discharge current density on the morphology of the Li2O2 deposit is considered. These treatments enable a more realistic simulation of the effect of the discharge product formation on carbon surfaces. The numerical discharging results are found to be in very good agreement with the experimental data at different current densities including 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mA cm−2. The present model is subsequently used to investigate the effect of the design parameters of the cathode (including the electrode thickness, the effective surface area and the cathode utilization) on the discharge performance.},

The active mass was catalysed with cobalt tetramethoxyphenylporphyrin. Various techniques such as impregnation, permeation, porosimetry, SEM observations and impedance spectroscopy were used to characterise the structure of the electrodes. The electrochemical behaviour was determined by means of polarisation curves in alkaline electrolyte. The catalytic activity and the physical characteristics of the carbon material strongly affect the performance and the life of the electrodes. The results significantly contribute to the proper selection of carbon materials and to optimisation of the electrode manufacturing technology. Besides the estimation of some structural parameters enables the correct simulation of electrode behaviour.},

abstract = {A few hundred ppm of water can cause detrimental changes in the lubricating
properties of engine oil. Electrochemical sensors based on electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were utilized to detect
water leaks and continuously monitor the time dependent dynamics
of water-oil interactions following the injection of water into industrial
lubricant. Immediately following the injection, water molecules interacted
with the oil additives (surfactants) forming a water-in-oil emulsion
based on inverse micelles. Emulsification was followed by gradual
loss of water from the solution through evaporation and electrolysis.
On-line data were used to characterize the dynamics of water micellization,
evaporation, and electrolysis. The values of kinetic rate constants
and diffusion coefficients for the components of the water/oil system
were determined. In order to support the experimental data and establish
the kinetics of water-oil interactions, literature equations describing
these interactions were adopted to develop a computational analysis
model. The model illustrated the processes occurring in the water/oil
system and resulted in an increased understanding of the recorded
experimental data. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Elevated temperature operation (above 80°C) of polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) is characterized by more difficult membrane hydration and low availability of oxygen to the cathode catalyst layer. Better membrane hydration and less resistance to oxygen transport are required for improved performance of PEFC, operated at elevated temperatures. Hence, diffusion media, being a gateway for reactant and product water transport between the gas channel and catalyst layer, require optimization to ensure an improved PEFC performance at elevated temperatures. In the present study, a functional dependence of cell voltage on diffusion media properties is characterized and a two-dimensional single-phase, non-isothermal model is used to study the effect of diffusion media properties on the performance of fuel cell operated at 95°C. It was found that there exists an optimum value of effective diffusive length of diffusion media that provides peak performance. In addition, a functionally graded diffusion media design is proposed that provides a better performance than conventional diffusion media at elevated temperature operation.},

The CL polarization curve, the rate of electrochemical conversion S(x) and the thickness of the conversion domain l∗ are derived for the cases of ideal transport of ions or feed molecules. In both cases, the CL may work in the low- or high-current regime. In the low-current regime with poor ionic transport, l∗ is given by the Newman’s current-independent reaction penetration depth. In the high-current regime, l∗ is inversely proportional to the cell current, regardless of the origin of transport loss. The position and width of the transition region between the low- and high-current branches of the polarization curve are calculated. Based on these results, the features of catalyst layer performance in PEMFC, HT-PEMFC, DMFC and SOFC are discussed.},

in these high voltage high energy density cathode materials are 1)
formation of tetrahedral lithium ions at voltage less than 4.45 V
and 2) the transition metal (TM) ions migration leading to phase
transformation on the surface of the materials. We show clear evidence
of a new spinel-like solid phase formed on the surface of the electrode
materials after high-voltage cycling. It is proposed that such surface
phase transformation is one of the factors contributing to the first
cycle irreversible capacity and the main reason for the intrinsic
poor rate capability of these materials.},

decreased with the graphitization of as-prepared carbon in spite

of carbon led to the dramatic morphological change from granular-type
to angulated-type, and as a consequence, the number of defect part
toward basal part was decreased. The defect parts of the carbon surface
were suggested to promote the Li+ containing oxygen reduction reaction
(Li+-ORR) related with the discharge voltage. Cyclic voltammetry
indicated that the ORR potential in the Li+ containing media was
positively shifted on the edge oriented carbon model plane, compared
with those of the graphitized ones. It was, thus, concluded that
the carbon surface including defects activated the Li+-ORR process
on a cathode, resulting in the increase of discharge voltage.},

abstract = {Our experimental results shown here disprove that finite diffusion
can generally be assumed in ac impedance models for H-2/air-polymer
electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) to account for the diffusive transport
of oxygen through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) toward the air electrode.
It is shown that the amplitude of the oxygen concentration oscillation
created as a consequence of superimposed ac current at the air electrode
is not zero at the channel/GDL interface but extends into the gas
channels, at least below modulation frequencies of f(mod)=10 Hz.
By this, sinusoidal oxygen-concentration oscillations within the
cathode gas channels are excited locally along the flow field. Due
to the forced air convection in the cathode flow-field channels,
a coupling via the gas phase occurs downstream of the flow field.
The coupling strongly affects the local and by this the overall impedance
response of the cell and evokes the formation of a low-frequency
arc in H-2/air-PEFC impedance spectra. Based on the experimental
results, a qualitative model is presented explaining the local impedance
response of a segmented 200 cm(2) H-2/air PEFC},

abstract = {Li-O2 batteries with super-high theoretical energy density are attracting extensive attention. However, the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reaction, the huge volume change from O2/Li2O2 conversion and the undesired electrolyte decomposition in cathode limit their performance. Herein we show design and synthesis of RuO2-coated ordered mesoporous carbon nanofiber arrays by using a natural crab shell template as a catalyst for Li-O2 battery, exhibiting several advantage features. First, the ordered mesopores in nanofibers facilitate electrolyte penetration and electron/ion transfer. In addition, the macro-sized voids between the nanofibers provide efficient buffer space for O2/Li2O2 accommodation and improve O2 diffusion. Furthermore, the uniform RuO2-coating layer alleviates undesired electrolyte decomposition and enhances the surface electronic conductivity. As a result, the battery displays high performance, including high capacity (20600 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1), high rate (9750 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1000 mA g−1) and long-life (300 cycles at a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g−1).},

electric vehicles, but the charge and discharge chemistries are complex
and not well understood. The active sites on cathode surfaces and
their role in electrochemical reactions in aprotic lithium-oxygen
cells are difficult to ascertain because the exact nature of the
sites is unknown. Here we report the deposition of subnanometre silver
clusters of exact size and number of atoms on passivated carbon to
study the discharge process in lithium-oxygen cells. The results
reveal dramatically different morphologies of the electrochemically
grown lithium peroxide dependent on the size of the clusters. This
dependence is found to be due to the influence of the cluster size
on the formation mechanism, which also affects the charge process.
The results of this study suggest that precise control of subnanometre
surface structure on cathodes can be used as a means to improve the
performance of lithium-oxygen cells.},

abstract = {We derived an intrinsic kinetic equation for the four-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media using free energies of activation and adsorption as the kinetic parameters. Our kinetic model consists of four essential elementary reactions:? a dissociative adsorption (DA) and a reductive adsorption (RA), which yield two reaction intermediates, O and OH; a reductive transition (RT) from O to OH; and a reductive desorption (RD) of OH. Analytic expressions were found for the O and OH adsorption isotherms by solving the steady-state rate equations. For the ORR on Pt(111) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution, we analyzed the measured polarization curves, thereby deducing activation free energies that are consistent with the values from theoretical calculations. The reductive adsorption (? = 0.46 eV) is not the rate-determining step (RDS) for the ORR on Pt because dissociative adsorption (? = 0.26 eV) offers a more favorable pathway at high potentials. It, however, generates strongly adsorbed O. The high activation barriers for the O to OH transition (? = 0.50 eV) and OH desorption (? = 0.45 eV) cause a large potential loss for the desorption-limited ORR. As the OH coverage increases to a constant value with decreasing potential, the Tafel slope increases to the value determined by a symmetric electron-transfer coefficient. We discuss the role of adsorption isotherm in kinetic analysis and, via activity-and-barrier plots, illustrate why the RDS may vary with reaction conditions or may not exist. Recognizing such features of electrocatalytic reactions can facilitate reaching the long-standing goal of quantitative descriptions and predictions of electrocatalysts' activities.

@article{Bartusik2012,
abstract = {Laser-coupled microphotoreactors were developed to bubble singlet
oxygen [(1)O(2) ((1)$\Delta$(g))] into an aqueous solution containing
an oxidizable compound. The reactors consisted of custom-modified
SMA fiberoptic receptacles loaded with 150 $\mu$m silicon phthalocyanine
glass sensitizer particles, where the particles were isolated from
direct contact with water by a membrane adhesively bonded to the
bottom of each device. A tube fed O(2) gas to the reactor chambers.
In the presence of O(2), singlet oxygen was generated by illuminating
the sensitizer particles with 669 nm light from an optical fiber
coupled to the top of the reactor. The generated (1)O(2) was transported
through the membrane by the O(2) stream and formed bubbles in solution.
In solution, singlet oxygen reacted with probe compounds (9,10-anthracene
dipropionate dianion, trans-2-methyl-2-pentanoate anion, N-benzoyl-D,L-methionine,
or N-acetyl-D,L-methionine) to give oxidized products in two stages.
The early stage was rapid and showed that (1)O(2) transfer occurred
via bubbles mainly in the bulk water solution. The later stage was
slow; it arose only from (1)O(2)-probe molecule contact at the gas/liquid
interface. A mechanism is proposed that involves (1)O(2) mass transfer
and solvation, where smaller bubbles provide better penetration of
(1)O(2) into the flowing stream due to higher surface-to-volume contact
between the probe molecules and (1)O(2).},

@article{Litster2004,
abstract = {The design of electrodes for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is a delicate balancing of transport media. Conductance of gas, electrons, and protons must be optimized to provide efficient transport to and from the electrochemical reactions. This is accomplished through careful consideration of the volume of conducting media required by each phase and the distribution of the respective conducting network. In addition, the issue of electrode flooding cannot be neglected in the electrode design process. This review is a survey of recent literature with the objective to identify common components, designs and assembly methods for PEMFC electrodes. We provide an overview of fabrication methods that have been shown to produce effective electrodes and those that we have deemed to have high future potential. The relative performances of the electrodes are characterized to facilitate comparison between design methodologies.},

abstract = {Controlling the mesoscale geometric configuration of catalysts on the oxygen electrode is an effective strategy to achieve high reversibility and efficiency in Li-O2 batteries. Here we introduce a new Li-O2 cell architecture that employs a catalytic polymer-based membrane between the oxygen electrode and the separator. The catalytic membrane was prepared by immobilization of Pd nanoparticles on a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber membrane and is adjacent to a carbon nanotube electrode loaded with Ru nanoparticles. During oxide product formation, the insulating PAN polymer scaffold restricts direct electron transfer to the Pd catalyst particles and prevents the direct blockage of Pd catalytic sites. The modified Li-O2 battery with a catalytic membrane showed a stable cyclability for 60 cycles with a capacity of 1000 mAh/g and a reduced degree of polarization ({\~{}} 0.3 V) compared to cells without a catalytic membrane. We demonstrate the effects of a catalytic membrane on the reaction characteristics associated with morphological and structural features of the discharge products via detailed ex situ characterization.},

Three possible generalizations are proposed, each one supported by a different scheme: continuous time random walks, non-local transport theory, and delayed flux-force relation. The properties of these generalizations are studied in both the long-time and the short-time regimes. In the long-time limit, we recover the mean-square displacement which is characteristic for these anomalous processes. As expected, the short-time behaviour is modified in comparison to generalized diffusion equations.},

This leads to a simple explicit relation between the imaginary and real parts of Z; with the typical fuel cell parameters, this relation is valid up to the frequency f≃100Hz. Fitting this equation to the low-frequency part of the faradaic impedance arc yields the Tafel slope of the oxygen reduction reaction and the CCL proton conductivity.

abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed to investigate
the electrochemical properties of LiCoO2 cathode. At initial state,
the Nyquist plots consist of one compressed semicircle in high and
intermediate frequency ranges that reflect charge transfer resistance
and a straight line inclined at a constant angle to the real axis
in lower frequency range that reflects the diffusion properties of
lithium ion in solid materials. When the cell was charged for several
hours, the Nyquist plots consist of two compressed semicircles alike
in appearance of a half ellipse at high and intermediate frequency
ranges and an anomalous line at lower frequency range, and the shape
of the second semicircle is a half ellipse in appearance almost.
The information of electrolyte resistance, surface film resistance
and charge transfer resistance have been obtained by modeling with
two different equivalent circuits according with the Nyquist plots
with different shape. It can be speculated that both the passivating
film on the surface of LiCoO2 cathode and the channels for lithium
ion transfer in LiCoO2 cathode are mostly formed during the first
charge/discharge process. Both diffusion coefficient of lithium ion
in LiCoO2 cathode and exchange current density are in accord with
the analysis of the Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectra,
indicating the rationality of the speculation.},

@article{Hartmann2013,
abstract = {This work reports on the cell chemistry of a room temperature sodium-oxygen
battery using an electrolyte of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether
(diglyme) and sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaSO3CF3, sodium
triflate). Different from lithium-oxygen cells, where lithium peroxide
is found as the discharge product, sodium superoxide (NaO2) is formed
in the present cell, with overpotentials as low as 100 mV during
charging. Several analytical methods are used to follow the cell
reaction during discharge and charge. Changes in structure and morphology
are studied by SEM and XRD. It is found that NaO2 grows as cubic
particles with feed sizes in the range of 10-50 $\mu$m; upon recharge
the particles consecutively decompose. Pressure monitoring during
galvanostatic cycling shows that the coulombic efficiency (e(-)/O2)
for discharge and charge is approx. 1.0, the expected value for NaO2
formation. Also optical spectroscopy is identified as a convenient
and useful tool to follow the discharge-charge process. The maximum
discharge capacity is found to be limited by oxygen transport within
the electrolyte soaked carbon fiber cathode and pore blocking near
the oxygen interface is observed. Finally electrolyte decomposition
and sodium dendrite growth are identified as possible reasons for
the limited capacity retention of the cell. The occurrence of undesired
side reactions is analyzed by DEMS measurements during cycling as
well as by post mortem XPS investigations.},

abstract = {A known macrohomogeneous model for the cathode catalyst layer of a low temperature fuel cell, which includes the kinetics of oxygen reduction at the catalyst∣electrolyte interface, proton transport through the polymer electrolyte network, and oxygen diffusion through hydrophobized voids, is considered. Analytical expressions in the relevant ranges of parameter values are obtained. These are the limits of (i) small currents, (ii) fast oxygen diffusion, (iii) fast proton transport, (iv) high current densities (when the layer is depleted in oxygen). They help to trace the main system properties and operation modes, and the routes for the structure-function optimization. Namely, they rationalize the explicit effect of the kinetic parameters of the oxygen reduction on the performance, the effect of the catalyst layer thickness, the width and the position of the active fraction of the layer, and the dependence of the performance on the oxygen partial pressure. In current–voltage plots, three regions are distinguished, each dominated by one of the three main physico-chemical processes in the cathode. Ranges of the optimum cathode thickness are revealed depending on the current density regimes. A bridge between the structural composition of the cathode and its performance is built with the help of an effective medium theory; the model reproduces the experimentally observed trends.},

EIS studies indicate that the interfacial impedance between the electrolyte and the silicon wafer increases upon continuous discharge. In addition, it is shown that the impedance of the air cathode-electrolyte interface is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the anode. Equivalent circuit fitting parameters indicate the difference in the anode-electrolyte interface characteristics for different types of silicon wafers. Evolution of porous silicon surfaces at the anode and their properties, by means of estimated circuit parameters, is also presented. Moreover, it is found that the silicon anode potential has the highest negative impact on the battery discharge voltage, while the air cathode potential is actually stable and invariable along the whole discharge period. The discharge capacity of the battery can be increased significantly by mechanically replacing the silicon anode.},

abstract = {Nearly all high energy density cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries
are well-ordered materials where lithium and other cations occupy
distinct sites. Cation-disordered materials are generally disregarded
as cathodes because lithium diffusion tends to be limited by their
structures. The performance of Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 shows that lithium
diffusion can be facile in disordered materials. Using ab initio
computations, we demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is due
to percolation of certain diffusion channels that are active in disordered
structures, but is unique to Li excess materials. This leads to a
unified understanding of high performance in both layered and Li
excess materials, and opens up an exciting new direction for designing
disordered electrode materials with high capacity and high energy

abstract = {Given their high theoretical specific energy, lithium–oxygen batteries have received enormous attention as possible alternatives to current state-of-the-art rechargeable Li–ion batteries. However, the maximum discharge capacity in non-aqueous lithium–oxygen batteries is limited to a small fraction of its theoretical value due to the build-up of insulating lithium peroxide (Li2O2), the battery’s primary discharge product. The discharge capacity can be increased if Li2O2 forms as large toroidal particles rather than as a thin conformal layer. Here, we show that trace amounts of electrolyte additives, such as H2O, enhance the formation of Li2O2 toroids and result in significant improvements in capacity. Our experimental observations and a growth model show that the solvating properties of the additives prompt a solution-based mechanism that is responsible for the growth of Li2O2 toroids. We present a general formalism describing an additive’s tendency to trigger the solution process, providing a rational design route for electrolytes that afford larger lithium–oxygen battery capacities.},

abstract = {A wide range catalyst screening with noble metal and oxide catalysts for a metal-air battery with an aqueous alkaline electrolyte was carried out. Suitable catalysts reduce overpotentials during the charge and discharge process, and therefore improve the round-trip efficiency of the battery. In this case, the electrodes will be used as optimized cathodes for a future lithium-air battery with an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Oxide catalysts were synthesized via atmospheric plasma spraying. The screening showed that IrO, RuO, LaCaCo, MnO, and CoO are promising bi-functional catalysts. Considering the high price for the noble metal catalysts further investigations of the oxide catalysts were carried out to analyze their electrochemical behavior at varied temperatures, molarities, and in case of LaCaCoO a varying calcium content. Additionally all catalysts were tested in a longterm test to proof cyclability at varied molarities. Further investigations showed that CoO seems to be the most promising bi-functional catalyst of the tested oxide catalysts. Furthermore, it was shown that a calcium content of x = 0.4 in LCCO has the best performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {A new procedure for estimating surface diffusivities and tortuosities within realistic models of complex porous structures is reported. Our approach uses Monte-Carlo tracer methods to monitor mean-square displacements for molecules restricted to wander on pore walls within model random mesoporous solids typical of those used as adsorbents, heterogeneous catalysts, and porous membranes. We consider model porous solids formed from initial packings of spheres with unimodal, Gaussian, or bimodal distributions of size; changes in pellet porosity are achieved by increasing microsphere radii and by randomly removing spheres from highly densified packings in order to simulate densification and coarsening, respectively. Geometric tortuosities for the surface phase reached large values at void fractions near 0.04 and 0.42 for densified solids; the surface tortuosity gave a minimum value of 1.9 at a void fraction of ∼0.26. These high tortuosities correspond to percolation thresholds for the void and solid phases, which in turn reflect packing densities at which each phase becomes discontinuous. Surface tortuosities for coarsened solids at low void fractions were similar to those in densified solids; however, at void fractions above ∼0.3, surface tortuosities of coarsened solids increased only gradually with void fraction, because coarsening retains significant overlap among spheres at void fractions above those giving disconnected solids in densified structures. Simulations of bulk diffusion within voids were used to compare the transport properties and connectivity of the void space with those of surfaces that define this void space. Surface and void tortuosities were similar, except for void fractions near the solid percolation threshold, because unconnected solid particles interrupt surface connectivity but not gas phase diffusion paths. Surface and void tortuosities were also similar for channels within linear chains of overlapping hollow spheres as both tortuosities increased with decreasing extent of sphere overlap. These simulations provide a basis for estimates of surface and void tortuosities, which are essential in the interpretation and extrapolation of diffusion rates in complex porous media. Surface and void diffusivity estimates differed significantly from those obtained from lattice and capillary models of complex porous structures.},

abstract = {Electrochemical degradation on silicon (Si) anodes prevents them from being successfully used in lithium (Li)-ion battery full cells. Unlike the case of graphite anodes, the natural solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films generated from carbonate electrolytes do not self-passivate on Si, causing continuous electrolyte decomposition and loss of Li ions. In this work, we aim at solving the issue of electrochemical degradation by fabricating artificial SEI films using a solid electrolyte material, lithium phosphorus oxynitride (Lipon), which conducts Li ions and blocks electrons. For Si anodes coated with Lipon of 50 nm or thicker, a significant effect is observed in suppressing electrolyte decomposition, while Lipon of thinner than 40 nm has a limited effect. Ionic and electronic conductivity measurements reveal that the artificial SEI is effective when it is a pure ionic conductor, but electrolyte decomposition is only partially suppressed when the artificial SEI is a mixed electronic-ionic conductor. The critical thickness for this transition in conducting behavior is found to be 40-50 nm. This work provides guidance for designing artificial SEI films for high-capacity Li-ion battery electrodes using solid electrolyte materials.},

abstract = {For a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), dry layer preparation was optimized and applied to fabricate a micro-porous layer (MPL) for a gas diffusion layer (GDL). The MPLs fabricated by dry layer preparation and the conventional wet layer preparation were compared by physical and electrochemical methods. The PEMFC using dry layer MPLs showed better performance than that using wet layer MPLs, especially when the cells were operated under conditions of high oxygen utilization rate and high humidification temperature of air. The mass transport properties of the GDLs with the dry layer MPLs were also better than with the wet layer MPLs, and were found to be related to the pore size distribution in GDLs. The differences in surface morphology and pore size distribution for the GDLs with the dry layer and wet layer MPLs were investigated and analyzed. The dry layer preparation for MPLs was found to be more beneficial for forming meso-pores (pore size in the range of 0.5–15$\mu$m), which are important and advantageous for facilitating gas transport in the GDLs. Moreover, the GDLs with the dry layer MPLs exhibited better electronic conductivity and more stable hydrophobicity than those with the wet layer MPLs. The reproducibility of the dry layer preparation for MPLs was also satisfying.},

abstract = {Rechargeable lithium-air (O2) batteries are receiving intense interest because their high theoretical specific energy exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries. If the Li-O2 battery is ever to succeed, highly reversible formation/decomposition of Li2O2 must take place at the cathode on cycling. However, carbon, used ubiquitously as the basis of the cathode, decomposes during Li2O2 oxidation on charge and actively promotes electrolyte decomposition on cycling. Replacing carbon with a nanoporous gold cathode, when in contact with a dimethyl sulphoxide-based electrolyte, does seem to demonstrate better stability. However, nanoporous gold is not a suitable cathode; its high mass destroys the key advantage of Li-O2 over Li ion (specific energy), it is too expensive and too difficult to fabricate. Identifying a suitable cathode material for the Li-O2 cell is one of the greatest challenges at present. Here we show that a TiC-based cathode reduces greatly side reactions (arising from the electrolyte and electrode degradation) compared with carbon and exhibits better reversible formation/decomposition of Li2O2 even than nanoporous gold (>98{\%} capacity retention after 100 cycles, compared with 95{\%} for nanoporous gold); it is also four times lighter, of lower cost and easier to fabricate. The stability may originate from the presence of TiO2 (along with some TiOC) on the surface of TiC. In contrast to carbon or nanoporous gold, TiC seems to represent a more viable, stable, cathode for aprotic Li-O2 cells.},

abstract = {Single chambered air-cathode microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are promising
to be scaled up as sustainable wastewater treatment systems. However,
the current air-cathode made by brushing noble metal catalyst and
Nafion binder onto carbon matrix becomes one of the biggest bottlenecks
for the further development of MFCs due to its high cost, huge labor-consuming
and less accuracy. A novel structure of air-cathode was constructed
here by rolling activated carbon (AC) and polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) as catalyst layer to enhance the reproducibility and improve
the performance by an optimized three-phase interface (TPI). Air-cathodes
with AC/PTFE ratios of 3, 5, 6, 8 and 11 in the catalyst layer were
prepared, and the physical and electrochemical techniques were employed
to investigate their surface microstructure and electrochemical characteristics.
Uniform cross-linked ropiness networks were observed from the catalyst
layer of all the cathodes and increased as the AC/PTFE ratio decreased,
while the exchange currents were positively related to this ratio.
Maximum power densities (MPDs) decreased as follows: AC/PTFE{\^{A}} ={\^{A}}
6 (802{\^{A}} mW{\^{A}} m(-2) at 3.4{\^{A}} A{\^{A}} m(-2)), 5 (704{\^{A}} mW{\^{A}} m(-2) at 2.2{\^{A}} mA{\^{A}}

2.1{\^{A}} A{\^{A}} m(-2)) and 11 (584{\^{A}} mW{\^{A}} m(-2) at 2.0{\^{A}} mA{\^{A}} m(-2)), which was
due to the changes of both the capacitance characteristics and conductivities
according to the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) analysis.
This study demonstrated that inexpensive, highly reproducible, high
performance and scalable air-cathode can be produced by rolling method
without using noble metal and expensive binder.},

abstract = {The Chapter summarizes recent analytical and semi-analytical results obtained within the scope of one-dimensional (1D) and quasi two-dimensional (Q2D) isothermal models of a direct methanol fuel cell. 1D model takes into account the diffusive transport of methanol and oxygen to the catalyst sites, methanol permeation through the membrane (crossover), Tafel rate of feed molecules conversion in the electrochemical reactions and the direct catalytic methanol-oxygen combustion on the cathode side. Quasi-2D model in addition accounts for a variation of methanol and oxygen concentrations along the respective channel and the effect of gaseous bubbles in the anode channel. The procedure of models construction is described in detail and the physical processes, which stand behind model equations are discussed. The most striking result yields Q2D model, which shows that crossover leads to localization of current production close to the inlet of the oxygen channel. At constant oxygen stoichiometry the cell generates finite local current even at vanishingly small total current in the load. This effect explains lowering of cell open-circuit voltage (mixed-potential). Recent experimental studies of Ye, Zhao, Yang and Prabhuran (Electrochem. Solid State Lett.8 (2005) A52), Muller, Dohle and Kulikovsky (Electrochem. Solid State Lett.9 (2006) L7) and Kulikovsky et al (Electrochem. Comm.8 (2006) 754) show that at open circuit the role of the load plays oxygendepleted part of the cell, which turns into electrolysis regime. CO2 bubbles in the anode channel dramatically reduce cell performance; however, under the shortage of oxygen the bubbles increase performance due to reduction of methanol crossover. The effect of non-Tafel kinetics of methanol oxidation on the anode catalyst layer performance is studies; the respective model reveals a novel regime of the active layer operation.},

@article{Paganin1998,
abstract = {In this work, several aspects related to the limiting polarization behavior of polymer electrolyte fuel cells were studied using ac impedance spectroscopy. The results were analyzed taking into account the different types of potential losses caused by the interfacial reaction kinetics, the conductance of the electrolyte in the catalyst layer, the oxygen diffusion in the gas phase, in the thin film and in the distributed agglomerate regions of the gas diffusion electrodes and the balance of water in the membrane. The main conclusion is that the water transport in the membrane plays an important role in establishing the limiting polarization behavior of polymer electrolyte fuel cells, corresponding to the only limiting factor when pure oxygen is employed as the cathodic reagent. When the oxygen source is air, the diffusion of oxygen in the gas phase becomes a limiting factor, but for pressurized systems the diffusion of water can also be observed, especially for thick membranes.},

abstract = {Room-temperature ionic liquids, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
(EMIBF4), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium 1-butylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate
(BPBF4), and 1-butylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
(BPTFSI), were prepared and characterized. The thermal property,
density, self-diffusion coefficient of the anions and cations, viscosity,
and ionic conductivity were measured for these ionic liquids in wide
temperature ranges. A pulsed-gradient spinecho NMR method was used
to independently measure self-diffusion coefficients of the anions
(19F NMR) and the cations (1H NMR). The results indicate that the
cations diffuse almost equally to the anion in EMIBF4 and BPBF4,
whereas they diffuse faster than the anion in EMITFSI and BPTFSI.
The summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coefficients
for each ionic liquid follows the order EMITFSI > EMIBF4 > BPTFSI
> BPBF4, under an isothermal condition. The order of the magnitude
of the diffusion coefficient well contrasts with that of the viscosity
for each ionic liquid. The temperature dependencies of the self-diffusion
coefficient, viscosity, and ionic conductivity obey the VogelTammanFulcher
(VTF) equation, and the VTF parameters were presented. Relationships
among the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and molar conductivity
were analyzed in terms of the StokesEinstein equation and the NernstEinstein
equation. The most interesting feature of the relationships is that
the ratios of the molar conductivity, determined by complex impedance
measurements, to that calculated from the NMR diffusion coefficients,
range from 0.6 to 0.8 for EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas the ratios range
from 0.3 to 0.5 for EMITFSI and BPTFSI. This difference could be
understood by taking the ionic association into consideration for
EMITFSI and BPTFSI.},

abstract = {Our recent 1D+1D model of DMFC, which takes into account gaseous bubbles in the anode channel is analyzed. In this work, we derive asymptotic solution to model equations for the case of small rate of bubbles formation. The formula for the change in the mean current density of the cell due to bubbles is obtained and the effect of bubbles on the limiting current density is rationalized. Physically, the bubbles (i) decrease time-average methanol concentration in the anode channel, which reduces cell performance and (ii) decrease methanol crossover, which improves it. The resulting effect is controlled by parameter $\gamma$, which is proportional to the ratio of inlet oxygen and methanol concentrations. If oxygen is in excess, the bubbles strongly decrease cell performance close to the limiting current and have marginal positive effect at small and medium currents. Under lack of oxygen the bubbles almost always dramatically improve performance. Furthermore, in that case there exists optimal stoichiometry of the flows, which provides maximal performance. The origin of these effects is discussed.},

abstract = {Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) gas diffusion layers (GDLs) play important parts in diffusing gas, discharging liquid water, and conducting electricity, etc. When liquid water is discharged through GDL to gas channel, there will be some pores of GDLs occupied by liquid water. In this study, based on a one-dimensional model, the distribution of liquid water phase saturation is analyzed for different GDL structures including GDL with uniform porosity, GDL with sudden change porosity (GDL with microporous layer (MPL)) and GDL with gradient porosity distribution. The effect on gas diffusion of the changes of porosity and liquid saturation due to water remaining in GDL pores is calculated. The conclusions are that for uniform porosity GDL, the gas diffusion increases with the increase of porosity and contact angle and increases with the decrease of the thickness of GDL; for GDL with MPL, the larger the MPL porosity and the thinner the MPL thickness are, the stronger the gas diffusion is; for gradient change porosity GDL with the same average equivalent porosity, the larger the porosity gradient is, the more easily the gas diffuses. The optimization for GDL gradient structure shows that the GDL with a linear porosity distribution of 0.4x+0.4 is the best of the computed cases.},

abstract = {We develop a theory for the electrical admittance of a rough interface under diffusion-limited and partial diffusion-limited charge transfer conditions. The large and small-frequency expansion brings out the relationships between the various morphological features of the rough electrode i.e. area, curvature and width, and the average admittance. The diffusion-limited reaction admittance is determined on an approximately self-affine corrugated random surface fractal. We obtain exact results for the low roughness and the asymptotic results (in three frequency regions) for the arbitrary and large roughness surfaces. These results show an anomalous frequency dependence for the mean admittance and the mean excess admittance for the large and small roughness surfaces, respectively. The intermediate frequency behavior of the reaction admittance for small roughness interfaces has the following form: ???Y??????(i??) 1/2+const.(i??)3/2-H, where H is Hurst's exponent, for the large roughness interfaces it has same form as predicted earlier: ???Y??????(i??)1-H/2. This non-universality and dependence of intermediate-frequency behavior on the strength of interfacial fractality has not been previously conceived. We also show the localization of the active zones in the presence of roughness. Finally, these results unravel the connection between the total reaction admittance and the crossover frequency to the roughness characteristics likes the fractal dimension, lower and upper fractal cutoff lengths, and the amplitude of the fluctuations of the fractal. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Jorcin2008,
abstract = {The corrosion behavior of a pure aluminum/pure copper couple in a weakly conductive sulfate solution was investigated. Potential and current distributions on the surface of the model couple at the beginning of immersion were obtained by solving the Laplace equation using a finite element method (FEM) algorithm. The potential distribution predicted by the calculations was checked using a Ag/AgCl microreference electrode. A good agreement was found between experimental and theoretical results. It was shown that the reaction occurring at the copper electrode was oxygen reduction, while aluminum remote from the Al/Cu interface remained in the passive state. Moreover, calculations predicted a large cathodic current, related to an increase in oxygen reduction, restricted to copper at the Al/Cu interface. This led to a local pH increase reaching values higher than 9, allowing the dissolution of aluminum to occur close to the interface. Combining these data with optical and scanning electron microscope observations after 24 h of immersion in the sodium sulfate solution allowed a three-step mechanism to be proposed to explain the corrosion damage, and particularly the presence of a copper deposit on the aluminum surface, some distance from the Al/Cu interface, a phenomenon currently observed in commercial copper-rich aluminum alloys.},

high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities, but solid deposits
on active surfaces can disturb charge transport and induce mechanical
stress. In this Letter we develop a nanoscale continuum model for
the growth of Li2O2 crystals in lithium-oxygen batteries with organic
electrolytes, based on a theory of electrochemical non-equilibrium
thermodynamics originally applied to Li-ion batteries. As in the
case of lithium insertion in phase-separating LiFePO4 nanoparticles,
the theory predicts a transition from complex to uniform morphologies
of Li2O2 with increasing current. Discrete particle growth at low
discharge rates becomes suppressed at high rates, resulting in a
film of electronically insulating Li2O2 that limits cell performance.
We predict that the transition between these surface growth modes
occurs at current densities close to the exchange current density
of the cathode reaction, consistent with experimental observations.},

abstract = {A mathematical model is developed to describe the impedance response of a porous electrode composed of spherical intercalation particles. The model considers a porous electrode without solution-phase diffusion limitations. The model is developed by first deriving the impedance response of a single intercalation particle, obtained by solving a set of governing equations which describe charge-transfer and double-layer charging at the surface, solid-phase diffusion inside the particle, and an open-circuit potential which varies as a function of intercalant concentration. The model also considers the effect of an insulating film surrounding the particle. The governing equations are linearized to take advantage of the small amplitude of the perturbing current in impedance analysis. Once the impedance of a single particle is determined, this result is incorporated into a model which describes a porous electrode limited by ohmic drop in the solution and solid phases, and by the impedance of the particles of which the porous elec- trode is composed. The model can be used to examine the effect of physical properties and particle-size distributions in the porous electrode, and the usefulness of impedance analysis to measure solid-phase diffusion coefficients is scrutinized.},

abstract = {The non-aqueous Li-air (O2) battery is receiving intense interest
because its theoretical specific energy exceeds that of Li-ion batteries.
Recharging the Li-O2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide
(Li2O2), which is formed on discharge within the porous cathode.
However, transporting charge between Li2O2 particles and the solid
electrode surface is at best very difficult and leads to voltage
polarization on charging, even at modest rates. This is a significant
problem facing the non-aqueous Li-O2 battery. Here we show that incorporation
of a redox mediator, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), enables recharging
at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator.
On charging, TTF is oxidized to TTF(+) at the cathode surface; TTF(+)
in turn oxidizes the solid Li2O2, which results in the regeneration
of TTF. The mediator acts as an electron-hole transfer agent that
permits efficient oxidation of solid Li2O2. The cell with the mediator
demonstrated 100 charge/discharge cycles.},

Li-air battery research to reduce overpotentials in both the oxygen
reduction (discharge) and especially oxygen evolution (charge) reactions.
In this study, we show that past reports of traditional cathode electrocatalysis
in nonaqueous Li-O(2) batteries were indeed true, but that gas evolution
related to electrolyte solvent decomposition was the dominant process
being catalyzed. In dimethoxyethane, where Li(2)O(2) formation is
the dominant product of the electrochemistry, no catalytic activity
(compared to pure carbon) is observed using the same (Au, Pt, MnO(2))
nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the onset potential of oxygen evolution
is only slightly higher than the open circuit potential of the cell,
indicating conventional oxygen evolution electrocatalysis may be
unnecessary.},

abstract = {Development of rechargeable lithium metal battery (LMB) remains a challenge because of uneven lithium deposition during repeated cycles of charge and discharge. Ionic liquids have received intensive scientific interest as electrolytes because of their exceptional thermal and electrochemical stabilities. Ionic liquid and ionic-liquid-nanoparticle hybrid electrolytes based on 1-methy-3-propylimidazolium (IM) and 1-methy-3-propylpiperidinium (PP) have been synthesized and their ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, mechanical properties, and ability to promote stable Li electrodeposition investigated. PP-based electrolytes were found to be more conductive and substantially more efficient in suppressing dendrite formation on cycled lithium anodes; as little as 11 wt {\%} PP-IL in a PC-LiTFSI host produces more than a ten-fold increase in cell lifetime. Both PP- and IM-based nanoparticle hybrid electrolytes provide up to 10 000-fold improvements in cell lifetime than anticipated based on their mechanical modulus alone. Galvanostatic cycling measurements in Li/Li4 Ti5 O12 half cells using IL-nanoparticle hybrid electrolytes reveal more than 500 cycles of trouble-free operation and enhanced rate capability.},

abstract = {Nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries have a much superior theoretical gravimetric energy density compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries, and thus could render long-range electric vehicles a reality. A molecular-level understanding of the reversible formation of lithium peroxide in these batteries, the properties of major/minor discharge products, and the stability of the nonaqueous electrolytes is required to achieve successful lithium-oxygen batteries. We demonstrate that the major discharge product formed in the lithium-oxygen cell, lithium peroxide, exhibits a magnetic moment. These results are based on dc-magnetization measurements and a lithium-oxygen cell containing an ether-based electrolyte. The results are unexpected because bulk lithium peroxide has a significant band gap. Density functional calculations predict that superoxide-type surface oxygen groups with unpaired electrons exist on stoichiometric lithium peroxide crystalline surfaces and on nanoparticle surfaces; these computational results are consistent with the magnetic measurement of the discharged lithium peroxide product as well as EPR measurements on commercial lithium peroxide. The presence of superoxide-type surface oxygen groups with spin can play a role in the reversible formation and decomposition of lithium peroxide as well as the reversible formation and decomposition of electrolyte molecules.},

abstract = {In present day technology, storing and processing of information occur on physically distinct regions of space. Not only does this result in space limitations; it also translates into unwanted delays in retrieving and processing of relevant information. There is, however, a class of two-terminal passive circuit elements with memory, memristive, memcapacitive and meminductive systems -- collectively called memelements -- that perform both information processing and storing of the initial, intermediate and final computational data on the same physical platform. Importantly, the states of these memelements adjust to input signals and provide analog capabilities unavailable in standard circuit elements, resulting in adaptive circuitry, and providing analog massively-parallel computation. All these features are tantalizingly similar to those encountered in the biological realm, thus offering new opportunities for biologically-inspired computation. Of particular importance is the fact that these memelements emerge naturally in nanoscale systems, and are therefore a consequence and a natural by-product of the continued miniaturization of electronic devices. We will discuss the various possibilities offered by memcomputing, discuss the criteria that need to be satisfied to realize this paradigm, and provide an example showing the solution of the shortest-path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the solution path.},

abstract = {Li–air batteries have generated enormous interest as potential high specific energy alternatives to existing energy storage devices. However, Li–air batteries suffer from poor rechargeability caused by the instability of organic electrolytes and carbon cathodes. To understand and address this poor rechargeability, it is essential to elucidate the efficiency in which O2 is converted to Li2O2 (the desired discharge product) during discharge and the efficiency in which Li2O2 is oxidized back to O2 during charge. In this Letter, we combine many quantitative techniques, including a newly developed peroxide titration, to assign and quantify decomposition pathways occurring in cells employing a variety of solvents and cathodes. We find that Li2O2-induced electrolyte solvent and salt instabilities account for nearly all efficiency losses upon discharge, whereas both cathode and electrolyte instabilities are observed upon charge at high potentials.},

The effects of temperature and time on chloromethylation of the polymer were investigated and the chloromethylation was optimized. Furthermore, different approaches for quaternization of the synthesized chloromethylated polymer were studied. The results show that both temperature and time exhibited significant impacts on chloromethylation and gelation. It was also found that using an appropriate quaternization approach could significantly improve the ionic conductivity and also could optimize the conductivity of the membrane even though the accessible functional chloromethyl groups were limited.

Physical property studies (SEM micrographs and pore size distribution) and electrochemical analyses in half-cell (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Polarization Curves for Oxygen Reduction and Cyclic Voltammetry) were carried out to characterise the structural and electrochemical behaviour of both methods. Finally, a cell performance investigation, using electrodes prepared by both methods was carried out at three different temperatures (125, 150, and 175°C), in a single PEMFC setup. A better behaviour was obtained for the “solution method” at the two highest temperatures at intermediate current densities, whereas at 125°C the best results were obtained with the “colloidal method” in all the current densities ranges. A discussion of the behaviours observed with the different characterisation techniques is made.},

Using a three electrode setup the current response from the anode
(Li metal) and cathode (GDE) can be separated and the changes of
the electrochemical processes at the GDE during discharge can be
observed, exclusively. We identify up to four processes with different
time constants which we assign to the lithium ion migration through
a surface layer, the charge-transfer from the carbon surface to the
molecular oxygen, the lithium ion and oxygen diffusion towards the
cathode surface and, in case of the mesoporous materials, the lithium
ion movement inside the pores, along the pore axis. The latter finding
reflects that pore clogging of such is a limiting factor for the
discharge of the Li/O2 battery. A large mesopore volume as in the
xerogel electrode, however, allows for a high storage capability
and a long and constant oxygen reduction. We demonstrate that the
three electrode EIS proves to be a powerful in situ diagnostic tool
to determine the state and, hence, the reversibility of the reactions
at the cathode.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review is to discuss progress in the understanding
of electrocatalytic reactions through the study of model systems
with surface spectroscopies. Pure metal single crystals and well-characterized
bulk alloys have been used quite successfully as models for real
(commercial) electrocatalysts. Given the sheer volume of all work
in electrocatalysis that is on fuel cell reactions, we will focus
on electrocatalysts for fuel cells. Since Pt is the model fuel cell
electrocatalyst, we will focus entirely on studies of pure Pt and
Pt bimetallic alloys. The electrode reactions discussed include hydrogen
oxidation/evolution, oxygen reduction, and the electrooxidation of
carbon monoxide, formic acid, and methanol. Surface spectroscopies
emphasized are FTIR, STM/AFM and surface X-ray scattering (SXS).
The discussion focuses on the relation between the energetics of
adsorption of intermediates and the reaction pathway and kinetics,
and how the energetics and kinetics relate to the extrinsic properties
of the model system, e.g. surface structure and/or composition. Finally,
we conclude by discussing the limitations that are reached by using
pure metal single crystals and well-characterized bulk alloys as
models for real catalysts, and suggest some directions for developing
more realistic systems. Nomenclature CTR crystal truncation rods

abstract = {The gas diffusion layer (GDL) plays a very important role in the performance of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The amount of compression on the GDL affects the contact resistance, the GDL porosity, and the fraction of the pores occupied by liquid water, which, in turn, affect the performance of a PEM fuel cell. In order to study the effects of GDL compression on fuel cell performance a unique fuel cell test fixture was designed and created such that, without disassembling the fuel cell, varying the compression of the GDL can be achieved both precisely and uniformly. Besides, the compression can be precisely measured and easily read out. Using this special fuel cell fixture, the effects of GDL compression on PEM fuel cell performance under various anode and cathode flow rates were studied. Two different GDL materials, carbon cloth double-sided ELAT and TORAY™ carbon fiber paper were used in these studies. The experimental results show that generally the fuel cell performance decreases with the increase in compression and over-compression probably exists in most fuel cells. In the low current density region, generally there exists an optimal compression ratio.},

a key role in the electrification of transport. However, the highest
energy storage possible for Li-ion batteries is insufficient for
the long-term needs of society, for example, extended-range electric

challenge; there are few options. Here we consider two: Li-air (O(2))

the operation of the cells is discussed, as are the significant hurdles
that will have to be overcome if such batteries are to succeed. Fundamental
scientific advances in understanding the reactions occurring in the
cells as well as new materials are key to overcoming these obstacles.
The potential benefits of Li-air and Li-S justify the continued research

abstract = {The unique properties of ionic liquids such as a relatively wide electrochemical stability window and very low vapor pressure have made them promising candidates as electrolytes for improving the cyclic performance of lithium-air batteries. The local current density, which is an important parameter in determining the performance of lithium-air batteries, is a function of the rate constant of the electron transfer reactions at the surface of the cathode. In this study, a novel method based on Marcus theory is presented to investigate the effect of varying the length of the alkyl side chain of model imidazolium based cations and the operating temperature on the rates of electron transfer reactions at the cathode. The necessary free energies of all the species involved in the multi-step reduction of oxygen into the peroxide ion were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). Our results indicate that the magnitude of the Gibbs free energy for the reduction of oxygen into the superoxide ion and also for the reduction of superoxide into the peroxide ion increases with an increase in the static dielectric constant of the ionic liquid. This trend in turn corresponds to the decrease in the length of the alkyl side chain of the ionic liquid cation. Furthermore, the change in Gibbs free energy decreases with increase in the operating temperature. The inner-sphere reorganization energies were evaluated using Nelsen's four point method. The total reorganization energies of all reduction reactions increase with decrease in the length of the alkyl side chain and increase in the operating temperature. Finally, the rate constants of the electron transfer reaction involved in the reduction of oxygen were calculated. The logarithm of the reaction rate constants decreases with increase in the static dielectric constant and increases with increase in the operating temperature. Our results provide fundamental insight into the kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transfer reactions at the cathode that will help in the identification of appropriate electrolytes for enhanced performance of lithium-air batteries.},

form of lithium peroxide with superoxide-like properties characterized
by a low temperature magnetic phase transition and a high O-O stretching
frequency (1125 cm(-1)). The magnetic phase transition and the high
O-O stretching frequency disappear when charged to above 3.7 V. Theoretical
calculations indicate that a surface superoxide structure on lithium
peroxide clusters and some lithium peroxide surfaces have an unpaired

Typical two-phase flow distributions in the cathode gas diffuser and gas channel are presented. The main parameters influencing water transport across the membrane are also discussed. By studying the influences of water and thermal management on two-phase flow, it is found that two-phase flow characteristics in the cathode depend on the current density, operating temperature, and cathode and anode humidification temperatures.},

@article{El-Kharouf2012,
abstract = {This paper presents the first part of a complete ex-situ characterisation
of a wide range of commercial Gas Diffusion Layers (GDLs) used in
low temperature and high temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)
fuel cells. Physical and electrical characteristics of the GDLs are
reported. The results show that the substrate structure has a significant
effect on the mechanical and electrical properties of the GDL. Moreover,
the Micro Porous Layer (MPL) structure determines the roughness of
the surface, and affects the permeability and porosity of the GDL.
It was found that the substrate treatment with PTFE affects the GDL
characteristics; PTFE loading increases the GDLs hydrophobicity and
permeability, however, decreases its overall porosity and resistivity.
Adding a MPL to the substrate, results in a decrease in porosity
and permeability and an increase in resistivity. The contact resistance
of the GDL and the bipolar plate increases when the GDL thickness
and PTFE loading are increased. This technical paper shows a close
relationship between GDL materials and their physical characteristics
and highlights the importance of optimising GDLs for fuel cell applications.

@misc{Hanggi1990,
abstract = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear
science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering,
and biology. Fifty years after Kramers{\{}'{\}} seminal paper on thermally
activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret
much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated
escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating
from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical
as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional
metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases.
The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted
with Kramers{\{}'{\}} reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction;
the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection
between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers{\{}'{\}} work for weakly damped
systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented,
together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole
regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover
theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety
of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated
in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the
role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly
multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified.
At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate
the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest
quantum versions of Kramers{\{}'{\}} theory are discussed, thereby providing
a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In
addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work
as it relates to Kramers{\{}'{\}} reaction-rate theory and to indicate
the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

cycling performance than GNSs when used in a rechargeable Li-air

abstract = {A multi-nuclear solid-state NMR approach is employed to investigate
the lithium-air battery, to monitor the evolution of the electrochemical
products formed during cycling, and to gain insight into processes
affecting capacity fading. While lithium peroxide is identified by
(17)O solid state NMR (ssNMR) as the predominant product in the first
discharge in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolytes, it reacts
with the carbon cathode surface to form carbonate during the charging
process. (13)C ssNMR provides evidence for carbonate formation on
the surface of the carbon cathode, the carbonate being removed at
high charging voltages in the first cycle, but accumulating in later
cycles. Small amounts of lithium hydroxide and formate are also detected
in discharged cathodes and while the hydroxide formation is reversible,
the formate persists and accumulates in the cathode upon further
cycling. The results indicate that the rechargeability of the battery
is limited by both the electrolyte and the carbon cathode stability.
The utility of ssNMR spectroscopy in directly detecting product formation
and decomposition within the battery is demonstrated, a necessary
step in the assessment of new electrolytes, catalysts, and cathode
materials for the development of a viable lithium-oxygen battery.},

@article{Wang2012,
abstract = {Due to its higher electrical conductivity compared with carbon and
its outstanding corrosion resistance, titanium nitride (TiN) has
recently been studied intensively for applications as an active electrode
as well as catalyst support materials in supercapacitors, fuel cells
and Li-air batteries. In this work, we studied the electrocatalytic
activities of nano- and micro-sized TiN toward the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) in an alkaline media using a thin film-rotating-disk
electrode (RDE) technique, and investigated their performances as
active air electrodes on a newly developed Li-air fuel cell with
a hybrid electrolyte. The results show that both nano- and micro-sized
TiN exhibit electrocatalytic activities toward ORR in alkaline media
but with different mechanisms. The ORR catalyzed by micro-sized TiN
proceeds via the serial "2e- + 2e-" pathway in a consecutive manner
with the reduction of HO2- starting at a higher electrode potential
as a discrete step. On the other hand, the ORR catalyzed by nano-sized
TiN proceeds via a dual-path, where the two serial "2e-" steps proceed
with smaller intervals and manifest an overall mixed appearance by
coexistence of the parallel and serial "2e-" steps. The extent to
which the two steps are in parallel or consecutive reveals a potential-dependent
feature. Furthermore, both nano- and micro-sized TiN particles demonstrate
evident electrocatalytic activities toward ORR in the Li-air fuel
cell, with the nano-sized TiN showing a much better catalytic activity,
which is comparable to that of the nano-sized Mn3O4.},

abstract = {The relatively large number of adjustable parameters often precludes the unambiguous interpretation of electrochemical impedance spectra in terms of a unique kinetic model. In the present paper, the possibilities offered by a combination between in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopic data and ex situ surface analytical information to improve the credibility of the estimates of the kinetic and transport parameters are discussed. Two electrode systems in which passive oxide films are formed - stainless steel in simulated pressurised water reactor coolant and tungsten in sulphate-fluoride solutions - are used as representative examples to demonstrate the different approaches taken to analyse the experimental data in terms of the Mixed-Conduction Model. Ways to extract information on the rate-limiting steps of the process of passive film formation, growth and restructuring by quantitative comparison of the model equations to electrochemical impedance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic data are described and the significance of the obtained parameters for the kinetics of the overall process of metal and alloy dissolution in the passive state is discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We study a model electrochemical thin film at dc currents exceeding the classical diffusion-limited value. The mathematical problem involves the steady Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for a binary electrolyte with nonlinear boundary conditions for reaction kinetics and Stern-layer capacitance, as well as an integral constraint on the number of anions. At the limiting current, we find a nested boundary layer structure at the cathode, which is required by the reaction boundary condition. Above the limiting current, a depletion of anions generally characterizes the cathode side of the cell. In this regime, we derive leading-order asymptotic approximations for the (i) classical bulk space-charge layer and (ii) another, nested highly charged boundary layer at the cathode. The former involves an exact solution to the Nernst-Planck equations for a single, unscreened ionic species, which may apply more generally to Faradaic conduction through very thin insulating films. By matching expansions, we derive current-voltage relations well into the space-charge regime. Throughout our analysis, we emphasize the strong influence of the Stern-layer capacitance on cell behavior.},

abstract = {Consequences of the well-known Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) continuum
equations of charge motion in liquids or solids for ordinary or anomalous
diffusion are investigated for an electrochemical cell with completely
blocking electrodes. Previous work is summarized and much of it is
shown to be independent of earlier published results and incomplete,
with little comparison made between ordinary and anomalous diffusion.
Such comparison is provided here and also includes variation of the
mobility ratio of the mobilities of positive and negative charges
from equality to charge of only one sign mobile. New generation-recombination
effects are demonstrated for a range of mobility ratios, with particular
attention given to those present for the case of charge of only one
sign mobile. No previous analyses of experimental data with PNP models
using complex-least-squares fitting have been published. Here such
a model is found to fit frequency response data well for a hydrogel
and to lead to estimates of physically meaningful parameters such
as the diffusion constant and ionic concentration. PNP analysis of
a synthetic data set derived from experimental results for liquid
electrolytes refutes claims made in the original publication dealing
with it, but verifies and extends an interesting analysis equation
proposed there. PNP fitting of data for solids, including ones showing
colossal low-frequency-limiting dielectric constants, suggests that
they may often be well described as arising from simple diffuse-charge
double-layer effects, and that continuum microscopic models such
as the PNP, in series with a conducting Debye response model, may
be sufficient for fitting well an appreciable amount of data involving
ion hopping and trapping behavior.},

abstract = {Aqueous Li-air batteries have attracted a great deal of attention
due to their high theoretical energy capacities. However, while still
in the early stages of research, the reported energy capacities of
Li-air batteries are far from what has been theoretically predicted.
In this research, we have designed a Li-air battery that has a Li
organic liquid electrolyte Li +- conducting glass ceramic plate (LiGC
plate) aqueous electrolyte Pt air electrode structure and studied
the impacts of the compositions of the aqueous electrolyte on the
battery performance. With lower concentrations of alkali aqueous
electrolytes (???0.05 M LiOH), a discharge voltage of approximately
3.5 V (at 0.05 mA cm -2) and a voltage efficiency up to 84{\%} were
observed. The addition of LiClO 4 into the aqueous solution slightly
lowered the discharge voltage to 3.3 V but dramatically decreased
the internal resistance of the battery to 35.4 ?? cm -2. With a charge
voltage plateau observed at 3.90 V at a current of 0.05 mA cm -2,
the Li organic liquid electrolyte LiGC 1 M LiClO 4 Pt air battery
showed an 85{\%} voltage efficiency at room temperature. Adding LiClO
4 into the aqueous electrolytes resulted in an impedance reduction
and slowed the pH increase of the alkaline-based electrolyte due
to the fast or long-term discharge of the air electrode in the Li-air
battery. The discharge and charge voltage behaviors of the battery
and the changes to the pH values of the aqueous electrolyte at different
current rates were also recorded and are presented in this paper.

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the electrochemical response of three types
of insertion electrodes: graphite and transition metal oxides that
intercalate reversibly with lithium, electronically-conducting polymers
with red-ox activity that can be doped reversibly, both positively
and negatively (i.e., at high and low potentials), and Chevrel phases
with Mo-S-Se elements, which intercalate reversibly with both lithium
and magnesium. The main point of interest is the correlation among
electrochemical kinetics, impedance, surface chemistry, 3D structure,
and morphology of these systems, studied by the use of electroanalytical
tools in conjunction with XRD, microscopy and spectroscopy. Magnesium
insertion into Chevrel phases and Li insertion into most of the electrodes
relevant to Li batteries involves phase transition. Thereby, the
electrodes' kinetics are affected by interfacial charge transfer
processes, solid-state diffusion, and the moving of boundaries between
phases. The electrochemical response of the electrodes reflects all
these processes. However, the identification of the relevant time
constants that affect the measured electrochemical behavior is not
trivial. Efforts are made in this paper to provide comprehensive
guidelines regarding the proper use of fine electrochemical tools
for the study of various types of insertion electrodes. ?? 2008 Elsevier

The real surface is of utmost importance in electrocatalysis, allowing determination and comparison of the intrinsic activities of different catalysts. EIS is a fast, in situ and a non-destructive method that allows the determination of the surface area of mono and multielement catalysts. In this study, Pt, Ru, and PtRu unsupported powders prepared by high energy ball milling (BM) were used as electroactive materials. They were inserted into cavity microelectrodes (CMEs) and studied in sulfuric acid solution. In addition, impedance method applied to porous materials allows for the determination of the porosity of the cavities. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Constant‐current discharge curves for the nickel hydroxide electrode
are simulated assuming resistances due to diffusion of protons and
conduction of electrons through the nickel hydroxide film, and charge‐transfer
resistance at the film/electrolyte interface contribute to the polarization
losses of the electrode. Good qualitative agreement is observed between
the model predictions and experimental discharge curves. The results
suggest that polarization losses due to diffusional limitations of
protons is a critical factor in determining the characteristics of
the discharge curve. Ohmic resistance has a significant effect on
the discharge curves at the end of discharge, and charge‐transfer
resistance is a minor contributor to the polarization losses. These
findings indicate that accurately measuring the diffusion coefficient
of protons, the thickness of the hydroxide film, the initial state‐of‐charge,
and the electronic conductivity as a function of state‐of‐charge
towards the end of discharge are critical in accurately predicting
the discharge characteristics of nickel hydroxide. Physical constants
which were shown to have minor influence on the discharge curves
are the film conductivity at the beginning of discharge, and the
exchange current density and cathodic transfer coefficient for the
reaction. The time‐dependent, one‐dimensional diffusion equation
has been solved analytically which should provide a computationally
efficient means of accounting for proton diffusion and variable electronic
conductivity in a macrohomogeneous battery model without sacrificing
accuracy.},

It is found that electrochemical reactions occur in a thin layer within a few micrometers thick, indicating ineffective catalyst utilization for the present catalyst layer design. The effective use of platinum catalyst decreases with increasing current density, hence lower loadings of platinum are feasible for higher current densities of practical interest without adverse effect on cell performance. The optimal void fraction for the catalyst layer is about 60{\%} and fairly independent of current density, and a 40{\%} supported platinum catalyst yields the best performance amongst various supported catalysts investigated. An optimal amount of membrane content in the void region of the catalyst layer exists for minimum cathode voltage losses due to competition between proton migration through the membrane and oxygen transfer in the void region. The present results will be useful for practical fuel cell designs.},

The results obtained from the performance evaluation and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses indicate that the loading of the carbon powder in the CFGDL plays a critical role in the performance of the fuel cell and utilization of Pt, but the presence of PTFE in the CFGDL has less influence. The carbon content in the CFGDL not only affects the area specific resistance of the CFGDL but also affects the Pt utilization of the catalyst layer, the total cell resistance and thus the cell performance. The optimal performance of the PEFC was obtained when the CFGDL was filled with carbon to 6mgcm−2 and PTFE of 40{\%}. The relationship between the surface morphology and microstructure of the CFGDL and the electrocatalytic activity of the cell is also discussed.},

Micro-SOFCs may be operated in either a single-chamber mode for which both electrodes are located on one side of a thin film electrolyte or in the more conventional two-chamber mode, in which electrodes are located on opposite sides of the electrolyte. The electrode geometries and film thicknesses necessary to achieve sufficiently low polarization resistances are evaluated for the single-chamber micro-SOFC. Interdigitated (comb-like) electrodes with characteristic feature sizes of a few micrometers are found to be essential to insure low polarization resistance. Requirements with respect to electrochemical properties of the electrodes are addressed as well. Numerical calculations are used to examine the correlation between decreasing electrolyte film thickness and ohmic polarization in two-chamber fuel cells. Current constriction at electrode particles or three phase boundaries render very low film thicknesses (below say 300 nm) not very sensible. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geometry-induced current and potential distributions modify the global impedance response of a disk electrode subject to faradaic reactions. The problem was treated for both linear and Tafel kinetic regimes. The apparent capacity of a disk electrode embedded in an insulating plane was shown to vary considerably with frequency. At frequencies above the characteristic frequency for the faradaic reaction, the global impedance response has a quasi-constant-phase element CPE character, but with a CPE coefﬁcient that is a function of both dimensionless frequency K and dimensionless current density J. For small values of J, approached unity, whereas, for larger values of J, reached values near 0.78. The calculated values of are typical of those obtained in impedance measurements on disk electrodes. For determining the interfacial capacitance, the inﬂuence of current and potential distributions on the impedance response cannot be neglected, even if the apparent CPE exponent has values close to unity. Several methods taken from the literature were tested to determine their suitability for extracting interfacial capacitance values from impedance data on disk electrodes. The best results were obtained using a formula which accounted for both ohmic and charge-transfer resistances.},

In this new formalism, the bulk behavior of the mobile charges is governed by a fractional diffusion equation in the presence of a reaction term. The solutions have to satisfy a general boundary condition embodying, in a single expression, most of the surface effects commonly encountered in experimental situations. Among these effects, we specifically consider the charge transfer process from an electrolytic cell to the external circuit and the adsorption-desorption phenomenon at the interfaces. The equations are exactly solved in the small AC signal approximation and are used to obtain an exact expression for the electrical impedance as a function of the frequency. The predictions of the model are compared to and found to be in good agreement with the experimental data obtained for an electrolytic solution of CdCl2H2O. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The oxygen mass transfer in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) was described using a pure diffusion equation that introduced equivalent oxygen diffusivity. The PEM fuel cell performance under the influence of current collector ribs was investigated. The results show that, the existence of ribs causes the GDL to be used only partly in the mass transfer process. The GDL effectiveness decreases with the cell current density and increases with the width of the gas flow channels. The PEM fuel cell performance decreases with an increase in GDL thickness if the GDL porosity is low. However, when a high-porosity GDL is used, the optimal thickness becomes an indicator determining the maximal PEM fuel cell performance.},

abstract = {The Faradaic impedance of a microdisk electrode inlaid in an insulating surface is revisited by numerical computation using a finite element method (FEM) with anisotropic mesh adaptation. New features of the numerical results, as compared to previous works, are analyzed. A first attractive feature is that the diffusion impedance relative to a microdisk electrode, evaluated at the equilibrium potential of the electrode, depends both on electron-transfer and mass-transport kinetics, in contrast with the usual behaviour of uniformly accessible electrodes. Next, the domain of validity of the Fleishmann and Pons semi-analytical formulation of diffusion impedance is determined. Finally, the characteristic of impedance graphs, which are the diffusion resistance, the characteristic frequency at the apex of the Nyquist diagram and the imaginary part of the diffusion impedance at this apex, are studied as functions of a dimensionless parameter that compares the standard rate constant of electron transfer to the microelectrode diffusion constant. Closed form approximations are proposed for all quantities in order to help the analysis of experimental data. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {NiF2/C composites were prepared through high energy mechanical milling,
and the cyclic performance was characterized by discharge-charge
measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) for NiF2/C
electrode were obtained at different potentials during initial discharge-charge
cycle. The results revealed the typical EIS characteristics appeared
with three semicircles in the Nyquist diagram at 1.6 V. An equivalent
circuit was proposed to simulate the experimental EIS data, and it
was found that the high frequency semicircle (HFS) is mainly caused
by lithium-ion through the SEI film on the electrode surface, the
middle frequency semicircle (MFS) should be related to the Schottky
contact between NiF2 and conductive agents, which may be the important
feature of such composites materials with big band gap, Besides the
low frequency arc (LFA) was observed as the charge transfer step.
Consequently a modified model was proposed to explain the impedance
response of NiF2/C electrode for lithium ion batteries.},

phosphate (Li3V2(PO4)3) with the NASICON structure was studied by
the constant current chronopotentiometry (also called as galvanostatic
charge-discharge technique), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and pulse chronoamperometry
(PITT). The shape of the cyclic voltammograms of the electrode under
study at various potential scan rates and galvanostatic charge-discharge
curves at various currents as well as the character of their change
during cycling were established. PITT current transients of the Li

into short, middle, and long-time fragments. The limiting current
obtained by means of the zero-moment extrapolation of the short-time
j,t fragment does not depend on the lithium concentration in the
intercalate, which pointed to its relation to the solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI), whereas the shape of the current transients over
the whole temporal scale was strongly influenced by the lithium content
in the electrode. By integration of current for each PITT step and
subsequent summation of charges the intercalation isotherm of the
Li3V 2(PO4)3 electrode was determined. The differential form of the
intercalation isotherm is in agreement with the cyclic voltammogram
shape at low potential scan rates (??? 0.05 mV s-1). Within the whole
j,t-curves of the Li3V2(PO 4)3 electrode the short-time j,t fragments
can be located where semi-infinite diffusion conditions are preserved
so that the mathematical treatment in the framework of such diffusion
type approximation with surface control is justified. The values
of the lithium diffusion coefficients (D) were found and the dependence
of D on the electrode potential was demonstrated. The lithium diffusion
coefficient ranges found by CV and PITT overlap and are within the

Li–O2 batteries still suffer from many inherent disadvantages such
as electrolyte stability, sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction/evolution
reactions in the aprotic environment and electrodes stability. Our
research demonstrates by combining electrochemical and analytical
techniques that the performances of Li–O2 batteries based on LiTFSI-Tetraglyme
electrolyte and Au-coated carbon electrodes are manly hindered by
the instability of the lithium metal anode in the oxygen-saturated
environment. Although the Au-coated carbon electrodes are able to
minimize side reactions arising from electrolyte decomposition, oxygen
crossover on the lithium metal results in the formation of decomposition
products (LiOH, Li2CO3) that are clearly detrimental for the battery
performance. Finally it is demonstrated that the Au-coated carbon
electrodes in combination with the LiTFSI-Tetraglyme electrolyte
can sustain extended cycling (100 cycles) when a more stable source
of Li-ion, namely lithium iron phosphate (LFP), is used.},

abstract = {Polymer-particle composites are used in virtually every field of technology.
When the particles approach nanometer dimensions, large interfacial
regions are created. In favorable situations, the spatial distribution
of these interfaces can be controlled to create new hybrid materials
with physical and transport properties inaccessible in their constituents
or poorly prepared mixtures. This review surveys progress in the
last decade in understanding phase behavior, structure, and properties
of nanoparticle-polymer composites. The review takes a decidedly
polymers perspective and explores how physical and chemical approaches
may be employed to create hybrids with controlled distribution of
particles. Applications are studied in two contexts of contemporary
interest: battery electrolytes and electrodes. In the former, the
role of dispersed and aggregated particles on ion-transport is considered.
In the latter, the polymer is employed in such small quantities that
it has been historically given titles such as binder and carbon precursor
that underscore its perceived secondary role. Considering the myriad
functions the binder plays in an electrode, it is surprising that
highly filled composites have not received more attention. Opportunities
in this and related areas are highlighted where recent advances in
synthesis and polymer science are inspiring new approaches, and where
newcomers to the field could make important contributions.},

The results show that both the porosity and thickness of the GDL affect the fuel cell performance significantly, especially the water mass transfer.

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that cyclic and linear carbonates, commonly
used solvents in Li ion battery electrolytes, are unstable in the
presence of superoxide and thus are not suitable for use in rechargeable
Li-air batteries employing aprotic electrolytes. A detailed understanding
of related decomposition mechanisms provides an important basis for
the selection and design of stable electrolyte materials. In this
article, we use density functional theory calculations with a Poisson-Boltzmann
continuum solvent model to investigate the reactivity of several
classes of aprotic solvents in nucleophilic substitution reactions
with superoxide. We find that nucleophilic attack by O(2)([sup]-)
at the O-alkyl carbon is a common mechanism of decomposition of organic
carbonates, sulfonates, aliphatic carboxylic esters, lactones, phosphinates,
phosphonates, phosphates, and sulfones. In contrast, nucleophilic
reactions of O(2)([sup]-) with phenol esters of carboxylic acids
and O-alkyl fluorinated aliphatic lactones proceed via attack at
the carbonyl carbon. Chemical functionalities stable against nucleophilic
substitution by superoxide include N-alkyl substituted amides, lactams,
nitriles, and ethers. The results establish that solvent reactivity
is strongly related to the basicity of the organic anion displaced
in the reaction with superoxide. Theoretical calculations are complemented
by cyclic voltammetry to study the electrochemical reversibility
of the O(2)/O(2)([sup]-) couple containing tetrabutylammonium salt
and GCMS measurements to monitor solvent stability in the presence
of KO(2)([sup]) and a Li salt. These experimental methods provide
efficient means for qualitatively screening solvent stability in
Li-air batteries. A clear correlation between the computational and
experimental results is established. The combination of theoretical
and experimental techniques provides a powerful means for identifying
and designing stable solvents for rechargeable Li-air batteries.},

abstract = {Gas and water management are key to achieving good performance from a PEM fuel cell stack. Previous experimentation had found, and this experimentation confirms, that one very effective method of achieving proper gas and water management is the use of an Interdigitated flow field design. However, the results of a single fuel cell with an Interdigitated flow field could not be extended to a multi-cell stack because of the inability to establish uniform gas flow to each individual cell. Since the interdigitated flow field uses the flow of gas for excess water removal, a deficient flow of gas causes the cell to become flooded. To alleviate this problem of unequal gas distribution, a method of sequentially exhausting each individual cell was developed. This method controls each cell’s exhaust so that only one cell at any given time has an open exhaust port, thereby, ensuring gas will flow through that cell. By sequentially exhausting each cell, it will be ensured that the gas will flow to each cell and provide the water management necessary to achieve good performance. This was demonstrated in a three-cell PEM stack with interdigitated flow fields operating at ambient pressure and temperature on neat hydrogen and oxygen. The results showed that the use of sequential exhaust control improved the peak power from 0.26W/cm2 per cell without exhaust control to 0.50W/cm2 per cell, a doubling of the power density.},

abstract = {Many battery electrodes contain ensembles of nanoparticles that phase-separate
on (de)intercalation. In such electrodes, the fraction of actively
intercalating particles directly impacts cycle life: a vanishing
population concentrates the current in a small number of particles,
leading to current hotspots. Reports of the active particle population
in the phase-separating electrode lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4;
LFP) vary widely, ranging from near 0{\%} (particle-by-particle) to
100{\%} (concurrent intercalation). Using synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy,
we probed the individual state-of-charge for over 3,000 LFP particles.
We observed that the active population depends strongly on the cycling
current, exhibiting particle-by-particle-like behaviour at low rates
and increasingly concurrent behaviour at high rates, consistent with
our phase-field porous electrode simulations. Contrary to intuition,
the current density, or current per active internal surface area,
is nearly invariant with the global electrode cycling rate. Rather,
the electrode accommodates higher current by increasing the active
particle population. This behaviour results from thermodynamic transformation
barriers in LFP, and such a phenomenon probably extends to other
phase-separating battery materials. We propose that modifying the
transformation barrier and exchange current density can increase
the active population and thus the current homogeneity. This could
introduce new paradigms to enhance the cycle life of phase-separating
battery electrodes.},

abstract = {The current-interrupt technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed in order to study the behavior of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) cathode containing 30 wt {\%} Nafion and 70 wt {\%} Pt/C. The steady-state polarization curves were also recorded. The experimental results were analyzed with help of the mathematical models developed in Part I of this paper. The effect of a varying oxygen pressure and humidity on the dynamic response of the cathode was investigated. The double-layer capacitance, Tafel slope, oxygen solubility, a group containing the effective O-2 diffusion coefficient and agglomerate size, and finally, the effective proton conductivity in the cathode were obtained. The parameter values were reasonable and attest the robustness of the agglomerate model for describing the PEFC cathode. At low humidity, a second, low-frequency loop was observed that was attributed to the membrane behavior. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical Society.},

abstract = {Li–O2 (or Li–air) battery currently represents a hot topic in the field of energy storage and conversion. The electrochemical performance of Li–O2 battery depends largely on the material and architecture of the catalytic cathode. In this work, we propose a unique design of binder-free catalytic cathode for Li–O2 batteries. The electrode consists of novel mushroom-like Au/NiCo2O4 nanohybrid on three-dimensional graphene (3D-G) grown directly on the skeleton of Ni foam. The Au/NiCo2O4/3D-G catalyst exhibits good catalytic effect for Li–O2 batteries, where Au directs the growth of Li2O2 mainly on the top of mushroom-like Au/NiCo2O4, and induces the crystallization of Li2O2 into thin-flake or thin-film form that is found to decompose relatively easily compared with large-particle form upon charge. Mushroom-like NiCo2O4 provides additional catalytic sites and acts as the support for both Au and Li2O2. Li–O2 battery with Au/NiCo2O4/3D-G catalyst can deliver a capacity of around 1275 mAh g–1 at 42.5 mA g–1. When the capacity is limited at 510 mAh g–1, the Li–O2 battery can sustain a stable cycling for 40 times.},

Nonlinear membrane resistance and voltage loss due to incomplete membrane humidification are calculated. Both values depend on parameter r, the ratio of mass transport coefficients of water in the membrane and in the backing layer. Simple equation for cell performance curve, which incorporates the effect of cathodic water is constructed. Depending of the value of r, the cell may operate in one of the two regimes. When r ≥ 1, incomplete membrane humidification simply reduces cell voltage; the limiting current density is determined by oxygen transport in the backing layer (oxygen-limiting regime). If r < 1, limiting current density is determined by membrane drying (water-limiting regime). In that case there exists optimal current density, which provides minimal membrane resistance. It is shown that membrane drying may lead to parasitic “in-plane” proton current.},

abstract = {The potential cycling of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) incorporating
a reference electrode was carried out for 20 h. After the potential
cycling, the maximum power density decreased from 56.12 mW cm-2 of
the fresh membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to 47.64 mW cm-2. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to conduct an independent quantitative
analysis of the anode and cathode degradation. The EIS results of
the anode and cathode revealed the degradation properties after the
potential cycling. For the anode, the charge transfer and mass transfer
resistances significantly increased after the degradation procedure,
indicating that a significant degradation occurred. However, for
the cathode, it was demonstrated that a slight degradation occurred,
because the charge transfer and mass transfer resistances slightly
increased after the degradation procedure. The increase in the charge
transfer resistance was attributed to the decrease in the Pt surface
area, and the increased mass transfer resistance was considered to
be due to the ionomer degradation. Meanwhile, the increase in the
membrane resistance and decrease in the adsorption resistance were
also observed after the degradation procedure. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Borosilicate glasses display a rich complexity of chemical behavior
depending on the details of their composition and thermal history.
Noted for their high chemical durability and thermal shock resistance,
borosilicate glasses have found a variety of important uses from
common household and laboratory glassware to high-tech applications
such as liquid crystal displays. In this paper, we investigate the
topological principles of borosilicate glass chemistry covering the
extremes from pure borate to pure silicate end members. Based on
NMR measurements, we present a two-state statistical mechanical model
of boron speciation in which addition of network modifiers leads
to a competition between the formation of nonbridging oxygen and
the conversion of boron from trigonal to tetrahedral configuration.
Using this model, we derive a detailed topological representation
of alkali-alkaline earth-borosilicate glasses that enables the accurate
prediction of properties such as glass transition temperature, liquid
fragility, and hardness. The modeling approach enables an understanding
of the microscopic mechanisms governing macroscopic properties. The
implications of the glass topology are discussed in terms of both
the temperature and thermal history dependence of the atomic bond
constraints and the influence on relaxation behavior. We also observe
a nonlinear evolution of the jump in isobaric heat capacity at the
glass transition when substituting SiO(2) for B(2)O(3), which can
be accurately predicted using a combined topological and thermodynamic
modeling approach.},

However, soft X-ray spectroscopy, one of the most sensitive probes of electronic states, has been mainly limited to ex situ experiments for battery research. Here we achieve in situ and operando soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy of lithium-ion battery cathodes. Taking advantage of the elemental, chemical and surface sensitivities of soft X-rays, we discover distinct lithium-ion and electron dynamics in Li(Co(¹/₃)Ni(¹/₃)Mn(¹/₃))O₂ and LiFePO₄ cathodes in polymer electrolytes. The contrast between the two systems and the relaxation effect in LiFePO₄ is attributed to a phase transformation mechanism, and the mesoscale morphology and charge conductivity of the electrodes. These discoveries demonstrate feasibility and power of in situ soft X-ray spectroscopy for studying integrated and dynamic effects in batteries.},

abstract = {The preferential solvation of solutes in mixed solvent systems is
an interesting phenomenon that plays important roles in solubility
and kinetics. In the present study, solvation of a lithium atom in
aqueous ammonia solution has been investigated from first principles
molecular dynamics simulations. Solvation of alkali metal atoms,
like lithium, in aqueous and ammonia media is particularly interesting
because the alkali metal atoms release their valence electrons in
these media so as to produce solvated electrons and metal counterions.
In the present work, first principles simulations are performed employing
the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics method. Spontaneous ionization
of the Li atom is found to occur in the mixed solvent system. From
the radial distribution functions, it is found that the Li(+) ion
is preferentially solvated by water and the coordination number is
mostly four in its first solvation shell and exchange of water molecules
between the first and second solvation shells is essentially negligible
in the time scale of our simulations. The Li(+) ion and the unbound
electron are well separated and screened by the polar solvent molecules.
Also the unbound electron is primarily captured by the hydrogens
of water molecules. The diffusion rates of Li(+) ion and water molecules
in its first solvation shell are found to be rather slow. In the
bulk phase, the diffusion of water is found to be slower than that
of ammonia molecules because of strong ammonia-water hydrogen bonds
that participate in solvating ammonia molecules in the mixture. The
ratio of first and second rank orientational correlation functions
deviate from 3, which suggests a deviation from the ideal Debye-type
orientational diffusion. It is found that the hydrogen bond lifetimes
of ammonia-ammonia pairs is very short. However, ammonia-water H-bonds
are found to be quite strong when ammonia acts as an acceptor and
these hydrogen bonds are found to live longer than even water-water
hydrogen bonds.},

@article{Biesheuvel2009b,
abstract = {We analyze the steady-state behavior of a general mathematical model for reversible galvanic cells, such as redox flow cells, reversible solid oxide fuel cells, and rechargeable batteries. We consider not only operation in the galvanic discharging mode, spontaneously generating a positive current against an external load, but also operation in two modes which require a net input of electrical energy: (i) the electrolytic charging mode, where a negative current is imposed to generate a voltage exceeding the open-circuit voltage, and (ii) the “super-galvanic” discharging mode, where a positive current exceeding the short-circuit current is imposed to generate a negative voltage. Analysis of the various (dis-)charging modes of galvanic cells is important to predict the efficiency of electrical to chemical energy conversion and to provide sensitive tests for experimental validation of fuel cell models. In the model, we consider effects of diffuse charge on electrochemical charge-transfer rates by combining a generalized Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equation for reaction kinetics across the compact Stern layer with the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck transport theory, without assuming local electroneutrality. Since this approach is rare in the literature, we provide a brief historical review. To illustrate the general theory, we present results for a monovalent binary electrolyte, consisting of cations, which react at the electrodes, and non-reactive anions, which are either fixed in space (as in a solid electrolyte) or are mobile (as in a liquid electrolyte). The full model is solved numerically and compared to analytical results in the limit of thin diffuse layers, relative to the membrane thickness. The spatial profiles of the ion concentrations and electrostatic potential reveal a complex dependence on the kinetic parameters and the imposed current, in which the diffuse charge at each electrode and the total membrane charge can have either sign, contrary perhaps to intuition. For thin diffuse layers, simple analytical expressions are presented for galvanic cells valid in all three (dis-)charging modes in the two subsequent limits of the ratio $\delta$ of the effective thicknesses of the compact and diffuse layers: (i) the “Helmholtz limit” ($\delta$→∞) where the compact layer carries the double layer voltage as in standard Butler-Volmer models, and (ii) the opposite “Gouy-Chapman limit” ($\delta$→0) where the diffuse layer fully determines the charge-transfer kinetics. In these limits, the model predicts both reaction-limited and diffusion-limited currents, which can be surpassed for finite positive values of the compact layer, diffuse layer and membrane thickness.},

abstract = {While battery performance is well predicted by the macrohomogeneous model of Newman and co-workers, predicting degradation and failure remains a challenge. It may be that, like most materials, failure depends on local imperfections and inhomogeneities. In this work we use tomographic data previously obtained for a commercial lithium-ion battery graphite composite electrode to evaluate the homogeneity of the tortuosity of the electrode by directly integrating the transport equations through its pore space. We find that the tortuosity of two halves of the electrode, each roughly 250 × 350 × 50 $\mu$m differ by about 30{\%}. On a smaller scale, 80 × 100 × 50 $\mu$m, local tortuosity variations up to a factor of 3 were observed. The Bruggeman relationship between porosity and tortuosity is also examined. We find that local porosity alone does not determine local tortuosity very well, and that the average relationship between porosity and tortuosity is not well predicted by the Bruggeman relationship for this electrode. We suggest that large local variations in tortuosity can lead to reduced capacity and life.},

abstract = {To understand the deterioration of cycle performance and energy efficiency related with non-aqueous rechargeable Li-air batteries, a micro-macro homogeneous model has been developed to include the practical feature of Li 2CO3 formation which occurs by electrolyte degradation during battery cycling. The discharge products can limit the cyclability and passivate the porous-cathode surface. A modelling study of cycling behaviour and cell performance for Li-air batteries in a non-aqueous electrolyte is presented which includes the influence of electrolyte solution degradation. The cycle performance deterioration measured in term of retention of discharge capacity on cycling was predicted from the developed model which includes the effect of irreversible Li2CO3 discharge product. A good agreement between this cell cycling simulation and porous-electrode experiment data is obtained, thus creating a more reliable model for a rechargeable Li-air battery in non-aqueous electrolyte. The cell cycling simulation and porous-electrode experiment indicate that there has been gradual decrease for retention of discharge capacity in a number of battery cycles due to the effect of irreversible formation of the Li2CO3 discharge product. The termination of the cell discharge is not from the pore blockage by the repeated depositing of discharge products as there are some available pores at the end of each discharge cycle.?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A novel PBI-based composite membrane with titanium oxide has been prepared. In order to compare the results obtained with this titanium PBI-based composite membrane, a standard PBI membrane, a PBI membrane prepared by a direct doping and casting method with TFA and a sulphonated PBI membrane were prepared. The membranes were physico-chemically and electrochemically characterised for use as electrolytes in high-temperature PEMFCs. All of the membranes were cast from the same polymer with the same molecular weight. The sulphonated and the composite membranes with TiO2 reached the highest doping levels under the same conditions. The sulphonated PBI membrane showed the highest conductivity at 125°C (0.18Scm−1). Only the composite membrane with TiO2 retained high conductivity values at the higher temperatures and this is a result of its high doping level and high water retention capacity. The TiO2–PBI composite membrane showed the best performance and achieved a power density of 800mWcm−1 at 150°C. The results suggest that TiO2/PBI-based composite membranes are promising electrolytes for high temperature PEMFCs.},

abstract = {Lithium−O 2 (Li−O 2) batteries are currently limited by a large charge overpotential at practically relevant current densities, and the origin of this overpotential has been heavily debated in the literature. This paper presents a series of electrochemical impedance measurements suggesting that the increase in charge potential is not caused by an increase in the internal resistance. It is proposed that the potential shift is instead dictated by a mixed potential of parasitic reactions and Li 2 O 2 oxidation. The measurements also confirm that the rapid potential loss near the end of discharge (" sudden death ") is explained by an increase in the charge transport resistance. The findings confirm that our theory and conclusions in ref 1, based on experiments on smooth small-area glassy carbon cathodes, are equally valid in real Li−O 2 batteries with porous cathodes. The parameter variations performed in this paper are used to develop the understanding of the electrochemical impedance, which will be important for further improvement of the Li−air battery.},

@article{Fitzpatrick2012,
abstract = {The dissolution of a compound results in the introduction and generation of gas bubbles in the solvent. This formation is due to entrained gases adhered to or trapped within the particles. Furthermore, a reduction in gas solubility due to the solute results in additional bubble generation. Their presence increases the compressibility of the solvent with the added effect of reducing the velocity of sound in the solvent. This effect is monitored via the frequency change of acoustic resonances that are mechanically provoked in the solvent and are now used as an insightful analytical technique. An experimental set up was designed to study a large number of compounds as a function of time, concentration, and solvent system. This revealed the role of the various physical and chemical mechanisms in determining the observed response. It is also shown that this response is strongly dependent on the physical and chemical characteristics of the solute compound used, therefore resulting in a method for the characterization of compounds and mixtures. Additional factors such as morphology (polymorphism), particle size, and dissolution rate are shown to be key in the variation of the resulting response. A mathematical model has also been developed in parallel, which inter-relates the various processes involved in the observed response. It is anticipated that BARDS will open up a new window into transient dissolution processes and compound characterization.},

abstract = {Carbon possesses unique electrical and structural properties that make it an ideal material for use in fuel cell construction. In alkaline, phosphoric acid and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), carbon is used in fabricating the bipolar plate and the gas-diffusion layer. It can also act as a support for the active metal in the catalyst layer. Various forms of carbon – from graphite and carbon blacks to composite materials – have been chosen for fuel-cell components. The development of carbon nanotubes and the emergence of nanotechnology in recent years has therefore opened up new avenues of materials development for the low-temperature fuel cells, particularly the hydrogen PEMFC and the direct methanol PEMFC. Carbon nanotubes and aerogels are also being investigated for use as catalyst support, and this could lead to the production of more stable, high activity catalysts, with low platinum loadings (<0.1mgcm−2) and therefore low cost. Carbon can also be used as a fuel in high-temperature fuel cells based on solid oxide, alkaline or molten carbonate technology. In the direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC), the energy of combustion of carbon is converted to electrical power with a thermodynamic efficiency close to 100{\%}. The DCFC could therefore help to extend the use of fossil fuels for power generation as society moves towards a more sustainable energy future.},

@article{Yang2015,
abstract = {The primary discharge product in sodium?air batteries has been reported in some experiments to be sodium peroxide, Na2O2, while in others sodium superoxide, NaO2, is observed. Importantly, cells that discharge to NaO2 exhibit low charging overpotentials, while those that discharge to Na2O2 do not. These differences could arise from a higher conductivity within the superoxide; however, this explanation remains speculative given that charge transport in superoxides is relatively unexplored. Here, density functional and quasi-particle GW methods are used to comparatively assess the conductivities of Na?O2 discharge phases by calculating the concentrations and mobilities of intrinsic charge carriers in Na2O2 and NaO2. Both compounds are predicted to be electrical insulators, with bandgaps in excess of 5 eV. In the case of sodium peroxide, the transport properties are similar to those reported previously for lithium peroxide, suggesting low bulk conductivity. Transport in the superoxide has some features in common with the peroxide but also differs in important ways. Similar to Na2O2, NaO2 is predicted to be a poor electrical conductor, wherein transport is limited by sluggish charge hopping between O2 dimers. Different from Na2O2, in NaO2 this transport is mediated by a combination of electron and hole polarons. An additional distinguishing feature of the superoxide is its ionic conductivity, which is 10 orders of magnitude larger than the electronic component. The ionic component is comprised primarily of p-type contributions from (surprisingly mobile) oxygen dimer vacancies, and from n-type contributions from negative sodium vacancies. In the context of sodium?air batteries, the low electronic conductivity afforded by NaO2 suggests that enhanced bulk transport within this phase is unlikely to account for the low overpotentials associated with its decomposition. Rather, the enhanced efficiency of NaO2-based cells should be attributed to other factors, such as a reduced tendency for electrolyte decomposition.},

abstract = {The stability of the high lithium ion conducting glass ceramics, Li1+x+yTi2{\{}-{\}}xAlxSiyP3{\{}-{\}}yO12
(LTAP) in alkaline aqueous solutions with and without LiCl has been
examined. A significant conductivity decrease of the LTAP plate immersed
in 0.057M LiOH aqueous solution at 50{\{}{\^{}}$\backslash$circ{\}}C for 3 weeks was
observed. However, no conductivity change of the LTAP plate immersed
in LiCl saturated LiOH aqueous solutions at 50{\{}{\^{}}$\backslash$circ{\}}C for 3 weeks
was observed. The pH value of the LiCl{\{}--{\}}LiOH{\{}--{\}}H2O solution with
saturated LiCl was in a range of 7{\{}--{\}}9. The molarity of LiOH and
LiCl in the LiOH and LiCl saturated aqueous solution were estimated
to be 5.12 and 11.57M, respectively, by analysis of Li+ and OH{\{}-{\}}.
The high concentration of LiOH and the low pH value of 8.14 in this
solution suggested that the dissociation of LiOH into Li+ and OH{\{}-{\}}
is too low in the solution with a high concentration of Li+. These
results suggest that the water stable LTAP could be used as a protect
layer of the lithium metal anode in the lithium/air cell with LiCl
saturated aqueous solution as the electrolyte, because the content
of OH{\{}-{\}} ions in the LiCl saturated aqueous solution does not increase
via the cell reaction of Li+1/2O2+H2O{\{}$\backslash$rightarrow{\}}2LiOH, and LTAP
is stable under a deep discharge state.},

abstract = {We investigate the subtle effects of diffuse charge on interfacial
kinetics by solving the governing equations for ion transport (Nernst-Planck)
with realistic boundary conditions representing reaction kinetics

limit {\$}\backslashepsilon = \backslashlambda{\_}D/L \backslashto
0{\$}, where {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}D{\$} is the Debye screening length
and {\$}L{\$} is the distance between the working and counter electrodes.
Using the methods of singular perturbation theory, we derive the
leading-order steady-state response to a nonzero applied current
in the case of the oxidation of a neutral species into cations, without
any supporting electrolyte. In certain parameter regimes, the theory
predicts a reaction-limited current smaller than the classical diffusion-limited
current. We also analyze the impedance of the electrochemical cell
when a small AC current modulation is added to an applied DC current.
At sufficiently high AC frequencies, the Maxwell displacement current
is found to exceed the Faradaic conduction current, and experimentally
observed ``negative impedances'' (out of phase AC voltage responses)
are predicted close to the reaction-limited current. Overall, we
demonstrate that the dynamics of diffuse charge plays a fundamental
role in nonequilibrium surface reactions when the transport of one
of the reacting species is coupled to the total interfacial reponse
of the compact and diffuse layers.},

abstract = {The current generation is not only facing the shortage of fossil fuels in the near future, but also is responsible for preserving the environment for future generations. As a result, the development of clean energy systems is becoming an urgent focus for the research community. Metal air batteries have attracted much attention due to their extremely high energy density, and the rechargeability which is directly governed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we present a new class of hybrid bi-functional catalyst consisting of porous nanorod perovskite La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF-PR) combined with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) active towards both ORR and OER. The novel morphology of LSCF-PR is prepared by an electrospinning method, and incorporated into NRGO sheets. Electron microscopy reveals interesting composite morphology in which LSCF-PR is embedded between the sheets of NRGO, forming an efficient LSCF-PR/NRGO composite morphology for the electrochemical oxygen reactions. Electrochemical testing of the LSCF-PR/NRGO composite in alkaline medium results in excellent ORR and OER catalytic activities, verifying the effective combination for bi-functionality. LSCF-PR/NRGO presents not only a comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst for ORR or OER, respectively, but also better durability. These results highlight the applicability of LSCF-PR/NRGO composite having unique and efficient morphology as a promising bi-functional catalyst for metal air battery applications.},

indicate that insulating Li2O2 particles with a disc-like shape were

phase presumably with high conductivity was formed on the rims of

abstract = {A novel approach to tuning electrochemical rectification using 2D
assemblies of quantum dots (QDs) is presented. Asymmetric enhancement
of the oxidation and reduction currents in the presence of the Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-)
redox couple is observed upon adsorption of QDs at thiol-modified
Au electrodes. The extent of the electrochemical rectification is
dependent on the average QD size. A molecular blocking layer is generated
by self-assembling 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and an ultrathin
film of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) on the electrode.
The polycationic film allows the electrostatic adsorption of 3-mercaptopropionic
acid (MPA)-stabilized CdTe QDs, generating 2D assemblies with approximately
0.4{\%} coverage. The QD adsorption activates a fast charge transfer
across the blocking layer in which the reduction process is more
strongly enhanced than the oxidation reaction. The partial electrochemical
rectification is rationalized in terms of the relative position of
the valence (VB) and conduction band (CB) edges with respect to the
redox Fermi energy ({\{}$\epsilon${\}}(redox)). Quantitative analysis of
the exchange current density obtained from electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy demonstrates that the enhancement of charge transport
across the molecular barrier is strongly dependent on the position
of the QD valence band edge relative to {\{}$\epsilon${\}}(redox). The
average electron tunneling rate constant through the QD assemblies
is estimated on the basis of the Gerischer model for electron transfer.},

abstract = {The non-aqueous Li-air (O2) battery is receiving intense interest because its theoretical specific energy exceeds that of Li-ion batteries. Recharging the Li-O2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2), which is formed on discharge within the porous cathode. However, transporting charge between Li2O2 particles and the solid electrode surface is at best very difficult and leads to voltage polarization on charging, even at modest rates. This is a significant problem facing the non-aqueous Li-O2 battery. Here we show that incorporation of a redox mediator, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), enables recharging at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator. On charging, TTF is oxidized to TTF(+) at the cathode surface; TTF(+) in turn oxidizes the solid Li2O2, which results in the regeneration of TTF. The mediator acts as an electron-hole transfer agent that permits efficient oxidation of solid Li2O2. The cell with the mediator demonstrated 100 charge/discharge cycles.},

can store lithium up to a reversible gravimetric capacity of approximately
200 mA h g(-1)(electrode) while also delivering 100 kW kg(electrode)(-1)

abstract = {Despite the promising high specific energy density of lithium−air batteries, their commercialization remains hindered by numerous issues, including the poor stability of the electrolyte due to its reaction with the superoxide radical (O2 •−) produced upon discharge at the battery’s cathode. In this work, we have used rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) voltammetry to study this reaction and to quantify the stability of the electrolyte against O2 •− by its pseudo-first-order reaction constant, k. Our results confirm the recently reported reactivity of propylene carbonate (PC, which was used in many of the initial works on Li−air batteries), while unveiling the enhanced stability of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Pyr14TFSI), with a k value at least 3 orders of magnitude lower than that estimated in PC. Moreover, our RRDE-transient measurements indicate that the diffusion of O2 •− in this ionic liquid is ≈70 times slower than that in PC, which could partially explain the poor discharge capacities observed in Li− air battery tests using Pyr14TFSI.},

discharge in an O2 atmosphere which contains H2O and CO2 impurities

therefore investigate the rechargeability of model cathodes pre-filled

of the formation/electrooxidation reactions. We show that Li2O2 is
the only reversible discharge product in ether-based electrolyte

irreversible and/or reacts with the electrolyte solution or the carbon

so, presumably on the basis of simplicity, the Butler-Volmer method

this study, the ability of Large Amplitude Fourier Transform AC Cyclic

is on the difference in the profiles of the first to sixth harmonics,
which are readily accessible when a large amplitude of the applied
ac potential is employed. In particular, it is demonstrated that
systematic analysis of the higher order harmonic responses in suitable
kinetic regimes provides predicted deviations of Marcus-Hush from
Butler-Volmer behaviour to be established from a single experiment
under conditions where the background charging current is minimal.},

abstract = {This study focuses on a determination of the cell voltage losses observed for Pt and PtRu loading reductions in H2/air and reformate/air polymer/electrolyte-membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Experiments with catalyst-coated membranes (CCM) of varying anode and cathode catalyst loadings with H2/O2 and H2/air demonstrate that the anode catalyst loading in state-of-the-art membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) operating on pure H2 can be reduced to 0.05mgPt/cm2 without significant voltage losses, while the cell voltage losses upon a reduction of the cathode catalyst loading from 0.40 to 0.20mgPt/cm2 for optimized MEAs amounts to 10–20mV, consistent with purely kinetic losses due to the oxygen reduction reaction. It is shown that H2/air operation with state-of-the-art MEAs very closely approaches the Pt-specific power density (in units of gPt/kW) for large-scale automotive fuel cell applications with pure H2 feed. For reformate/air operation, PtRu anode loadings can be reduced to 0.20mgPtRu/cm2 for reformate containing 100ppm CO with a 2{\%} air-bleed. Any further reduction will, however, require either a change in operating conditions (i.e. lower CO concentration or cell temperature ⪢80°C) or novel, more CO-tolerant anode catalysts.},

abstract = {New test equipment and characterization methods for aging investigations on lithium-ion cells for automotive applications are presented in this work. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a well-established method for cell characterization and analyzing electrochemical processes. In order to integrate this method into long-term aging studies with real driving currents, new test equipment is mandatory. The presented test equipment meets the demands for high current, wide bandwidth and precise measurement. This allows the cells to be cycled and characterized without interruption for changing the test device. The characterization procedures must be of short duration and have a minimum charge-throughput for negligible influence on the aging effect. This work presents new methods in the time and the frequency domain for obtaining the impedance spectrum which allow a flexible trade-off between measurement performance, time consumption and charge-throughput. In addition to sinusoidal waveforms, rectangular, Gaussian and sin(x)/x pulses are applied for EIS. The performance of the different methods is discussed. Finally, the time domain analysis is applied with real driving currents which provides impedance spectra for state of charge estimation considering aging effects in the car.},

surface process. The critical thickness sets the optimum size of
the nano-particle oxide electrocatalyst and this provides an important
nano-structuring requirement for metal oxide electrocatalyst design.},

how the mobile ions accumulate near charged electrodes. Here, we
present the excess ion depth profiles of ILs in ionomer membrane

Experimental results reveal that for the IL studied, cations and
anions are accumulated at both electrodes. The large difference in
the total volume occupied by the excess ions between the two electrodes
cause the observed large bending actuation of the actuator. Hence
we demonstrate that ToF-SIMS experiment provides great insights on

abstract = {Mixed-valence manganites with the ABO3 perovskite structure display a variety of magnetic and structural transitions, dramatic changes of electrical conductivity and magnetoresistance effects. The physical properties vary with the relative concentration of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the octahedral corner-sharing network, and the proportion of these two cations is usually changed by doping the trivalent large A cation (for example, La3+) with divalent cations. As the dopant and the original cation have, in general, different sizes, and as they are distributed randomly in the structure, such systems are characterized by local distortions that make it difficult to obtain direct information about their crystallographic and physical properties. On the other hand, the double oxides of formula AA'3Mn4O12 contain a perovskite-like network of oxygen octahedra centred on the Mn cations, coupled with an ordered arrangement of the A and A' cations, whose valences control the proportion of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the structure. The compound investigated in this work, (NaMn3+(3))(Mn3+(2)Mn4+(2))O12, contains an equal number of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the octahedral sites. We show that the absence of disorder enables the unambiguous determination of symmetry, the direct observation of full, or nearly full, charge ordering of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in distinct crystallographic sites, and a nearly perfect orbital ordering of the Mn3+ octahedra.},

abstract = {Carbon nano-materials were applied to the gas diffusion layers of PEMFC. Gas diffusion layers consist of gas diffusion medium(carbon cloth or carbon paper) and micro-layers. Carbon blacks, such as Vulcan XC 72, have been widely used for the micro-layers. Main functions of gas diffusion layers are distribution of reactants to the active site of electrode, management of water supplied and/or generated and enhancement of electrical contact between the electrode and the bipolar plates. In this work, nano-fibers and nano-tubes are adopted to the micro-layer of gas diffusion layers. By applying nano-materials, thinner micro-layers can be fabricated. This newly made micro-layer showed higher gas permeability and good electric conductivity with similar degree of water management as well as enhanced performance.},

abstract = {A comprehensive non-isothermal, 3D computational model for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells has been developed, and implemented into a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code. The model allows parallel computing, thus making it practical to perform well-resolved simulations for large computational domains. The model accounts for convective and diffusive transport and allows prediction of the concentration of species. Distributed heat generation associated with the electrochemical reaction in the cathode and anode is included in the model. The model solves for the electric and ionic potentials in the electrodes and membrane, and the local activation overpotential distribution is resolved, rather than assumed uniform, making it possible to predict the local current density distribution more accurately. Maximum current densities are predicted under the land areas as a result of the dominant influence of ohmic losses over concentration losses on the activity at the catalyst layer. A parametric analysis shows that substantially different spatial distributions can be obtained by varying the asymmetry parameter with no noticeable change in the global current density and polarization curve. Changing the conductivity radically alters the current distribution by changing the relative influence of ohmic to activation overpotentials.},

Among the two different GDLs investigated, the one with standard microporous layer is promising as high capacity cathode. Cell charge/discharge capability was evaluated and the results strongly support a discharge mechanism which mainly involves Li2O2 formation/dissolution at the cathode. The studies by XRD confirmed the existence of Li2O2 particles as the only detected product on the discharged cathode which is deposited and grown up at the surface as well as inside the microporous layer. The cell with GDL cathode maintains a very good cyclability under potential/time controlled mode with minimum amount of electrolyte decomposed products.},

abstract = {The dynamics of an infinite one-dimensional system of hard rods is generalized to include the effects of a random background. Each rod follows a trajectory which is described by a generalized random function and when two rods collide they interchange velocities (and trajectories). An exact solution is obtained for the distribution fs(x,v,tv′) which is the probability of finding a particle at x with velocity v at time t that was at x=0 with velocity v′ at t=0. The most interesting result is that in the long-time limit p(x,t), which is the probability of finding a particle at x at time t that was at x=0 at t=0, is of the form t−14exp(−x2t12). Thus, the spatial distribution does not become Gaussian and Fick's law is not valid. It is suggested that this qualitative behavior might be expected whenever single-file effects become important and that it is not dependent on the details of the one-dimensional hard-rod collisions which have been used in the derivation.},

abstract = {The corrosion behavior of pure magnesium in sodium sulfate solutions was investigated using voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with a rotating disk electrode. The analysis of impedance data obtained at the corrosion potential was consistent with the hypothesis that Mg corrosion is controlled by the presence of a very thin oxide film, probably MgO, and that the dissolution occurs at film-free spots only. This hypothesis was substantiated both by the superposition of the EIS diagrams, obtained for different immersion times and for two Na2SO4 concentrations once normalized, and by use of scanning electrochemical microscopy in the ac mode to sense the local conductivity of the material. On the basis of the electrochemical results, a model was proposed to describe magnesium corrosion at the open-circuit potential. Simulation of the impedance diagrams was in good agreement with the experimental results. (c) 2006 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.},

Such diagnostic methods are desired to probe the influence of factors such as charge rate, electrode structure and solid electrolyte interphase layer transport resistance as they relate to lithium-ion battery performance and durability. In this work, we present a continuous measurement of through-plane lithium distributions in a composite graphite/lithium metal electrochemical cell. Capacity change in a thick graphite electrode was measured during several charge/discharge cycles with high resolution (14$\mu$m) neutron imaging. A custom test fixture and a method for quantifying lithium are described. The measured lithium distribution within the graphite electrode is given as a function of state of charge. Bulk transport resistance is considered by comparing intercalation rates through the thickness of the electrode near the separator and current collector. The residual lithium content associated with irreversible capacity loss that results from cycling is also measured.},

@article{Trahey2013,
abstract = {It has become clear that cycling lithium-oxygen cells in carbonate electrolytes is impractical, as electrolyte decomposition, triggered by oxygen reduction products, dominates the cell chemistry. This research shows that employing an $\alpha$-MnO2/ramsdellite-MnO2 electrode/electrocatalyst results in the formation of lithium-oxide-like discharge products in propylene carbonate, which has been reported to be extremely susceptible to decomposition. X-ray photoelectron data have shown that what are likely lithium oxides (Li2O2 and Li2O) appear to form and decompose on the air electrode surface, particularly at the MnO2 surface, while Li2CO3 is also formed. By contrast, cells without $\alpha$-MnO2/ramsdellite-MnO2 fail rapidly in electrochemical cycling, likely due to the differences in the discharge product. Relatively high electrode capacities, up to 5000 mAh/g (carbon + electrode/electrocatalyst), have been achieved with non-optimized air electrodes. Insights into reversible insertion reactions of lithium, lithium peroxide (Li2O2) and lithium oxide (Li2O) in the tunnels of $\alpha$-MnO2, and the reaction of lithium with ramsdellite-MnO2, as determined by first principles density functional theory calculations, are used to provide a possible explanation for some of the observed results. It is speculated that a Li2O-stabilized and partially-lithiated electrode component, 0.15Li2O·$\alpha$-LixMnO2, that has Mn4+/3+ character may facilitate the Li2O2/Li2O discharge/charge chemistries providing dual electrode/electrocatalyst functionality.},

abstract = {Lithiumair batteries, based on their high theoretical specific energy, are an extremely attractive technology for electrical energy storage that could make long-range electric vehicles widely affordable. However, the impact of this technology has so far fallen short of its potential due to several daunting challenges. In nonaqueous Liair cells, reversible chemistry with a high current efficiency over several cycles has not yet been established, and the deposition of an electrically resistive discharge product appears to limit the capacity. Aqueous cells require water-stable lithium-protection membranes that tend to be thick, heavy, and highly resistive. Both types of cell suffer from poor oxygen redox kinetics at the positive electrode and deleterious volume and morphology changes at the negative electrode. Closed Liair systems that include oxygen storage are much larger and heavier than open systems, but so far oxygen- and OH --selective membranes are not effective in preventing contamination of cells. In this review we discuss the most critical challenges to developing robust, high-energy Liair batteries and suggest future research directions to understand and overcome these challenges. We predict that Liair batteries will primarily remain a research topic for the next several years. However, if the fundamental challenges can be met, the Liair battery has the potential to significantly surpass the energy storage capability of todays Li-ion batteries. © 2011 The Electrochemical Society.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effect of the anode diffusion layer on the cell performance and stability of a direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC). Carbon paper with various PTFE contents and thicknesses is used as the anode diffusion layer. In the case of the DBFC, both hydrogen evolution and liquid fuel diffusion have to be considered while selecting an anode diffusion layer. Among the various PTFE-containing diffusion layers, the non-contained diffusion layer yields the best performance. Adding PTFE to the diffusion layer leads to improved gas transport but is unsuitable in the DBFC. In addition, the thinnest (100$\mu$m) diffusion layer gives the best performance among the diffusion layers with various thicknesses. The decrease in the length of the diffusion path is beneficial for both the release of hydrogen gas and the diffusion of liquid fuel. In addition, it is found that the hydrogen evolution rate increases with increasing cell performance. Overall, adequate diffusion of liquid fuel is more important for the performance of a DBFC than the release of hydrogen gas.},

Ag particles of average size of 4.7 nm were uniformly distributed on the RGO sheets. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is studied on Ag-RGO catalyst in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes by using cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode techniques. As the interest in non-aqueous electrolyte is to study the catalytic performance of Ag-RGO for rechargeable Li-O2 cells, these cells are assembled and characterized. Li-O2 cells with Ag-RGO as the oxygen electrode catalyst are subjected to charge-discharge cycling at several current densities. A discharge capacity of 11 950 mA h g(-1) (11.29 mA h cm(-2)) is obtained initially at low current density. Although there is a decrease in the capacity on repeated discharge-charge cycling initially, a stable capacity is observed for about 30 cycles. The results indicate that Ag-RGO is a suitable catalyst for rechargeable Li-O2 cells.},

These expressions show that the cell may operate in one of the three regimes: (i) oxygen-limiting (local current density j exponentially decreases with the distance z along the channel); (ii) water-limiting (j exponentially increases with z); (iii) mixed regime: water-limiting close to the channel inlet and oxygen-limiting in the rest part of the cell. Recently measured and model profiles of local current density are in good agreement. In the mixed regime a large parasitic along-the-channel proton current may arise. The expressions for the limiting current density of the cell, for optimal feed composition and for optimal oxygen stoichiometry are derived.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional model available in the literature for conventional gas distributors was expanded to account for the dimension along the length of the channel. The channel was discretized into control volumes in series that were treated as well mixed. An iterative solution procedure was incorporated in each control volume to determine the average current density and the corresponding oxygen consumption and water generation rates. Downstream channel concentrations were calculated based on stoichiometric flow rates and the solution obtained from the preceding control volumes. Comparison of the model results with experimental data and the existing two-dimensional model showed that accounting for the oxygen concentration variations along the channel and its effect on the current density is critical for accurately predicting the cathode performance. Variations in the current density along the channel were strongly influenced by the changes in oxygen concentration caused by consumption due to reaction and dilution caused by water evaporation. Operating parameters that facilitated better water removal by evaporation like higher temperature and stoichiometric flow rates and lower inlet stream humidity resulted in higher net current. Operating conditions that resulted in minimal loss in oxygen concentrations resulted in a more uniform current density distribution along the channel.},

@article{Song2006,
abstract = {A one-dimensional, non-isothermal, two-phase transient model has been developed to study the transient behaviour of water transport in the cathode gas diffusion layer of PEM fuel cells. The effects of four parameters, namely the liquid water saturation at the interface of the gas diffusion layer and flow channels, the proportion of liquid water to all of the water at the interface of the cathode catalyst layer and the gas diffusion layer, the current density, and the contact or wetting angle, on the transient distribution of liquid water saturation in the cathode gas diffusion layer are investigated. Especially, the time needed for liquid water saturation to reach steady state and the liquid water saturation at the interface of the cathode catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer are plotted as functions of the above four parameters. The ranges of water vapour condensation and liquid water evaporation are identified across the thickness of the gas diffusion layer. In addition, the effects of the above four parameters on the steady state distributions of gas phase pressure, water vapour concentration, oxygen concentration and temperature are also presented. It is found that increasing any one of the first three parameters will increase the water saturation at the interface of the catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer, but decrease the time needed for the liquid water saturation to reach steady state. When the liquid water saturation at the interface of the gas diffusion layer and flow channels is high enough (≥0.1), the liquid water saturation at steady state is almost uniformly distributed across the thickness of the gas diffusion layer. It is also found that, under the given initial and boundary conditions in this paper, evaporation takes place within the gas diffusion layer close to the channel side and is the major process for water phase change at low current density (<2000Am−2); condensation occurs close to the catalyst layer side within the gas diffusion layer and dominates the phase change at high current density (>5000Am−2). For hydrophilic gas diffusion layers, both the time needed for liquid water saturation to reach steady state and the water saturation at the interface of the catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer will increase when the contact angle increases; but for hydrophobic gas diffusion layers, both of them decrease when the contact angle increases.},

D/L???0, where ?? D is the Debye screening length and L is the distance between the working and counter electrodes. Using the methods of singular perturbation theory, we derive the leading-order steady-state response to a nonzero applied current in the case of the oxidation of a neutral species into cations, without any supporting electrolyte. In certain parameter regimes, the theory predicts a reaction-limited current smaller than the classical diffusion-limited current; this over potential effect is not due to ohmic drop effects in the bulk of the cell but rather to antagonist processes involved in the surface charge transfer and diffuse layer charging respectively. We demonstrate that the charging of diffuse charge, since it is intimately coupled to the surface reaction and cannot be considered independently, plays a fundamental role in nonequilibrium surface reactions when the transport of one of the reacting species is coupled to the total interfacial response of the compact and diffuse layers. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In today's world, there is a continuous global need for more energy which, at the same time, has to be cleaner than the energy produced from the traditional generation technologies. This need has facilitated the increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) technologies and primarily of renewable energy sources (RES). The extensive use of such energy sources in today's electricity networks can indisputably minimize the threat of global warming and climate change. However, the power output of these energy sources is not as reliable and as easy to adjust to changing demand cycles as the output from the traditional power sources. This disadvantage can only be effectively overcome by the storing of the excess power produced by DG-RES. Therefore, in order for these new sources to become completely reliable as primary sources of energy, energy storage is a crucial factor. In this work, an overview of the current and future energy storage technologies used for electric power applications is carried out. Most of the technologies are in use today while others are still under intensive research and development. A comparison between the various technologies is presented in terms of the most important technological characteristics of each technology. The comparison shows that each storage technology is different in terms of its ideal network application environment and energy storage scale. This means that in order to achieve optimum results, the unique network environment and the specifications of the storage device have to be studied thoroughly, before a decision for the ideal storage technology to be selected is taken. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Although dominating the consumer electronics markets as the power
source of choice for popular portable devices, the common lithium
battery is not yet suited for use in sustainable electrified road
transport. The development of advanced, higher-energy lithium batteries
is essential in the rapid establishment of the electric car market.
Owing to its exceptionally high energy potentiality, the lithium-air
battery is a very appealing candidate for fulfilling this role. However,
the performance of such batteries has been limited to only a few
charge-discharge cycles with low rate capability. Here, by choosing
a suitable stable electrolyte and appropriate cell design, we demonstrate
a lithium-air battery capable of operating over many cycles with
capacity and rate values as high as 5,000 mAh g(carbon)(-1) and 3
A g(carbon)(-1), respectively. For this battery we estimate an energy
density value that is much higher than those offered by the currently
available lithium-ion battery technology.},

abstract = {Non-aqueous Li-air or Li-O(2) cells show considerable promise as a
very high energy density battery couple. Such cells, however, show
sudden death at capacities far below their theoretical capacity and
this, among other problems, limits their practicality. In this paper,
we show that this sudden death arises from limited charge transport
through the growing Li(2)O(2) film to the Li(2)O(2)-electrolyte interface,
and this limitation defines a critical film thickness, above which
it is not possible to support electrochemistry at the Li(2)O(2)-electrolyte
interface. We report both electrochemical experiments using a reversible
internal redox couple and a first principles metal-insulator-metal
charge transport model to probe the electrical conductivity through
Li(2)O(2) films produced during Li-O(2) discharge. Both experiment
and theory show a "sudden death" in charge transport when film thickness
is {\~{}}5 to 10 nm. The theoretical model shows that this occurs when
the tunneling current through the film can no longer support the
electrochemical current. Thus, engineering charge transport through
Li(2)O(2) is a serious challenge if Li-O(2) batteries are ever to
reach their potential.},

@article{Borodin2009,
abstract = {Quantum chemistry studies of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) complexes with Li+ and LiPF6 have been conducted. We found that Li+ complexation significantly stabilizes the highly polar cis-trans DMC conformation relative to the nearly nonpolar gas-phase low energy cis-cis conformer. As a consequence, the binding of Li+ to EC in the gas phase is not as favorable relative to binding to DMC as previously reported. Furthermore, quantum chemistry studies reveal that, when complexation of LiPF6 ion pairs is considered, the DMC/LiPF6 complex is about 1 kcal/mol more stable than the EC/LiPF6 complex. The EC3DMC(cis-cis)/Li+ complex was found to be the most energetically stable among ECnDMCm/Li+ (n+m=4) investigated complexes followed by EC4/Li+. Results of the quantum chemistry studies of these complexes were utilized in the development of a many-body polarizable force field for EC:DMC/LiPF6 electrolytes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of EC/LiPF6, DMC/LiPF6, and mixed solvent EC:DMC/LiPF6 electrolytes utilizing this force field were performed at 1 M salt concentration for temperatures from 298 to 363 K. Good agreement was found between MD simulation predictions and experiments for thermodynamic and transport properties of both pure solvents and the electrolytes. We find increased ion pairing with increasing DMC content; however, both EC and DMC were found to participate in Li+ solvation in mixed EC:DMC electrolytes despite a huge difference in their dielectric constants. In contrast to previous NMR studies, where dominance of EC in cation solvation was reported, we find a slight preference for DMC in the cation solvation shell for EC:DMC (1 wt:1 wt) electrolytes and show that reanalyzed Raman spectroscopy experiments are in good agreement with results of MD simulations. Finally, analysis of solvent residence times reveals that cation transport is dominated by motion with solvating DMC and approximately equal contributions from vehicular motions with the first solvation shell and solvent exchange with respect to solvating EC.},

In order to gain a more profound understanding of the role of the electrolyte, properties such as the Li salt diffusion coefficient, the Li+ transference number, and the Li salt activity all need to be measured in addition to the conductivity. The situation is further complicated by the fact that high currents change the cell temperature and also create strong concentration gradients in the electrolyte. A full set of transport properties for LiPF6 in a propylene carbonate/ethylene carbonate/dimethyl/carbonate mixture were measured as a function of temperature and LiPF6 concentration. The Li+ transference number was found to be fairly constant with concentration. The activity and diffusion coefficient were both found to vary strongly with temperature and concentration. The temperature dependence of the transport properties is shown to be crucial for making predictions of cell performance at high currents.},

The nanowires were synthesized at least on a gram scale at a pilot scale facility, and various surface modification methods were developed to optimize the electrochemical performance. The observed electrochemical performance of the silicon nanowires was clearly dependent on the origination of the surface functional group, either from the residual precursor or from surface modifications. On the basis of detailed electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and confocal Raman spectroscopy studies, we analyzed the surface chemical reactivity of the silicon nanowires with respect to their electrochemical performance in terms of their capacity retention over continuous charge-discharge cycles.},

abstract = {The nonaqueous lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) battery is investigated in a contained, high pressure O2 system. Increasing the O2 pressure from 1 atm to 10 atm of O2 increased the discharge potential by 10{\%} when discharged at 100 ??A cm-2 from 2.65 V to 2.77 V. In addition, the cell discharge capacity increased from 1400 mAh gC -1 at 1 atm of O2 to 2100 mAh gC -1 at 10 atm at 100 ??A cm-2. The discharge capacity of the 1 atm O2 cell decreased to 100 mAh gC -1 at 1000 ??A cm-2, while at 10 atm of O2 it retained one third of the 100 ??A cm-2 capacity at 2100 ??A cm-2 and two thirds the 1 atm/100 ??A cm-2 capacity at 500 ??A cm-2. This increase in capacity results from a more efficient utilization of the carbon electrode surface at higher pressures. As seen by SEM, the thickness of the discharge product layer was much greater when discharged under higher pressures, indicating more O2 reached the active carbon surfaces and was reduced. In addition, at high pressure the electrode surface was more evenly used, having fewer areas with little or no discharge products. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The cross flow from channel to channel through gas diffusion layer (GDL) under the land could play an important role for water removal in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this study, characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL have been investigated experimentally, through measuring unsteady pressure drop in a cell which has the GDL initially wet with liquid water. The thickness of GDL is carefully controlled by inserting various thicknesses of metal shims between the plates. It has been found that severe compression of GDL could result in excessive pressure drop from channel inlet to channel outlet. Removing liquid water from GDL by cross flow is difficult for GDL with high compression levels and for low inlet air flow rates. However, effective water removal can still be achieved at high compression levels of GDL if the inlet air flow rate is high. Based on different compressed GDL thicknesses, different GDL porosities and permeabilities were calculated and their effects on the characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL were evaluated. Visualization of liquid water transport has been conducted by using transparent flow channel, and liquid water removal from GDL under the land was observed for all the tested inlet air flow rates, which confirms that cross flow is practically effective to remove the liquid water accumulated in GDL under the land area.},

abstract = {A theoretical investigation of the effects of elastic coherency strain on the thermodynamics, kinetics, and morphology of intercalation in single LiFePO(4) nanoparticles yields new insights into this important battery material. Anisotropic elastic stiffness and misfit strains lead to the unexpected prediction that low-energy phase boundaries occur along {\{}101{\}} planes, while conflicting reports of phase boundary orientations are resolved by a partial loss of coherency in the [001] direction. Elastic relaxation near surfaces leads to the formation of a striped morphology with a characteristic length scale predicted by the model, yielding an estimate of the interfacial energy. The effects of coherency strain on solubility and galvanostatic discharge are studied with a reaction-limited phase-field model that quantitatively captures the influence of misfit strain, particle size, and temperature on solubility seen in experiments. Coherency strain strongly suppresses phase separation during discharge, which enhances rate capability and extends cycle life. The effects of elevated temperature and the feasibility of nucleation are considered in the context of multiparticle cathodes.},

@article{Chu2003,
abstract = {An investigation is made of the effects of the change of the porosity of the gas diffuser layer (GDL) on the performance of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The analysis of fuel cell performance with non-uniform porosity of GDL is a necessity because the presence of liquid water in the GDL leads to a non-uniformly distributed porosity in the GDL. To implement this performance analysis, a half-cell model which considers the oxygen mass fraction distribution in the gas channel, the GDL and the catalyst layer, and the current density and the membrane phase potential in the catalyst layer and the membrane is investigated. Four continuous functions of position are employed to describe the porosity, and differential equations are derived based on oxygen transportation and Ohm’s law for proton migration and solved numerically. Results show that a fuel cell embedded with a GDL with a larger averaged porosity will consume a greater amount of oxygen, so that a higher current density is generated and a better fuel cell performance is obtained. This explains partly why fuel cell performance deteriorates significantly as the cathode is flooded with water (i.e. to give a lower effective porosity in the GDL). In terms of the system performance, a change in GDL porosity has virtually no influence on the level of polarization when the current density is medium or lower, but exerts a significant influence when the current density is high. This finding supports the scenario proposed by previous studies that the polarization at high current density corresponds mainly to mass transfer through (or the concentration activation of) the membrane assembly.},

abstract = {This investigation elucidates the electrochemical reaction process
occurring within lithium-sulfur battery cells in detail, which has
been unclear even after a half century of study primarily due to
the very high reactivity of the polysulfide species. The polysulfide
intermediates were deactivated by organic conversion - benzylization,
and LC/MS and NMR analyses were first applied. The results demonstrate
that the second voltage plateau in the discharge profile, which is
the most important step in practical use because of its constant
voltage, is dominated by the reduction of the Li2S3 intermediate.
The first voltage plateau and the transition state between the plateaus,
in which the voltage varies with the capacity, are associated with
multiple reactions including the decomposition of S8 into Li2Sx (x
= 1 to 7) and the transformation of Li2Sy (y = 4 to 8) into Li2Sz
(z = 1 to 3). It is also revealed that longer polysulfide species,
Li2Si (i = 6 to 8), are responsible for the redox shuttle phenomenon,
which causes serious capacity degradation.},

@article{Mukherjee2011,
abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an explosion of research and development efforts in the area of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC), perceived as the next generation clean energy source for automotive, portable and stationary applications. Despite significant progress, a pivotal performance/durability limitation in PEFCs centers on two-phase transport and mass transport loss originating from suboptimal liquid water transport and flooding phenomena. Liquid water blocks the porous pathways in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the catalyst layer (CL), thus hindering oxygen transport from the flow field to the electrochemically actives sites in the catalyst layer. Different approaches have been examined to model the underlying transport mechanisms in the PEFC with different levels of complexities. Due to the macroscopic nature, these two-phase models fail to resolve the underlying structural influence on the transport and performance. Mesoscopic modeling at the pore-scale offers great promise in elucidating the underlying structure-transport-performance interlinks in the PEFC porous components. In this article, a systematic review of the recent progress and prospects of pore-scale modeling in the context of two-phase transport in the PEFC is presented. Specifically, the efficacy of lattice Boltzmann (LB), pore morphology (PM) and pore network (PN) models coupled with realistic delineation of microstructures in fostering enhanced insight into the underlying liquid water transport in the PEFC GDL and CL is highlighted.},

This effect could be attributed to a shortage of water in the proton conducting membrane leading to an increase of the membrane proton-conduction resistance as well as to a increase of the activation overpotential for the hydrogen oxidation reaction due to a decrease in the number of active sites on the anode side. To fortify this thesis, we present measurements of the fuel cell impedance, varying the membrane thickness, the ionic density, and the humidification conditions of the reactants. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

in tetrahydrofurane (THF) and propylene carbonate (PC) solutions

LiBF4, LiPF6, LiSO3CF3 and LiN(SO2CF3)2. The correlation between
the electrochemical properties, surface chemistry and morphology
of Li electrodes in the above systems was studied using impedance
spectroscopy, surface sensitive in situ and ex situ FTIR, X-ray microanalysis,
electron microscopy and standard experiments of charge discharge
cycling. It was found that all the salt anions explored have strong
effects on all the above aspects, eg they strongly affect Li surface
chemistry in solutions and participate in the build-up of surface
films. The electrical properties of the Li-solution interphase formed
in the different salt solutions are remarkably dependent on the salt
anion. Consequently, the morphology and Li utility in repeated charge-discharge
cycling are also strongly influenced by the salt used. Except for
the Li halides, all the salts studied seem to be more reactive to
lithium than LiClO4 and LiAsF6. They are worse than the commonly
used LiAsF6 for rechargeable Li battery systems because their strong
involvement in the Li surface chemistry adversely affects Li cycling
efficiency.},

the two models are equivalent only if the phenomenological parameter

Reversible behaviour is observed under a wide range of experimental conditions; provided that a limiting cell voltage is not exceeded. Above this threshold value, relaxation effects are observed followed by the development of high concentration polarization overpotentials. The Li/(PEO)xLiF3CSO3 system exhibits classical redox behaviour and the potentiometric results can be explained planed according to the reaction: LiLi+e-right arrow over left arrowV-Li+Li. According to this model, maximum concentrations of available Li sites in the polymer lattice are calculated and are in good agreement with conductivity measurements reported elsewhere. $\backslash$nValues of the exchange current density, io, are calculated for a range of experimental conditions and are particularly high at higher temperatures, (e.g., at 140°C and x=9, io=11.2 mA/cm2).

abstract = {A novel rechargeable Li/O2 battery is reported. It comprises a Li+ conductive organic polymer electrolyte membrane sandwiched by a thin Li metal foil anode, and a thin carbon composite electrode on which oxygen, the electroactive cathode material, accessed from the environment, is reduced during discharge to generate electric power. It features an all solid state design in which electrode and electrolyte layers are laminated to form a 200 to 300 p.m thick battery cell. The overall cell reaction during discharge appears to be 2Li + °2 Li,0,. It has an open-circuit voltage of about 3 V, and a load voltage that spans between 2 and 2.8 V depending upon the load resistance. The cell can be recharged with good coulombic efficiency using a cobalt phthalocyanine catalyzed carbon electrode.},

abstract = {The flow distribution in fuel cells has an important influence on both the power density and efficiency of fuel cell systems. In order to effectively utilize the area, flow distribution should be as homogeneous as possible. In addition, pressure losses should be minimized with regard to the power demand of auxiliary components as pumps and compressors. In polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) the flow field is in direct contact with the diffusion layer. The main task of the diffusion layer is to distribute the reactants from the flow field towards the catalyst layer. To prevent diffusion overvoltages, the diffusion layer is in general highly porous and provides high fluxes of the reactants. Consequently, the flow distribution in the flow field can be superpositioned by a flow in the diffusion layer. In this paper, we discuss the interaction between the diffusion layer and the flow field. Experimentally, we characterized different diffusion layers with regard to their diffusion properties as well as different flow fields. Additional simulation studies help to understand the processes and to determine suitable combinations of flow fields and diffusion layers.},

@article{Zalc2004,
abstract = {Tracer diffusion simulations within random porous structures show that tortuosity factors are independent of diffusion mechanism for all practical void fractions when an equivalent Knudsen diffusivity is correctly defined. Previous studies concluded that tortuosity factors, a geometric property of the void space as defined, increase with increasing Knudsen number, Kn, a measure of the relative number of molecule-surface and intermolecular collisions. The model porous structures in this study consist of random-loose packings of spheres overlapped to achieve a given void fraction and to accurately reflect the void space in practical porous solids. Effective diffusivities were estimated using tracer or flux-based Monte Carlo methods for Knudsen numbers of 10-3-1010; the two methods lead to similar diffusivities for void fractions of 0.06-0.42. Tortuosity factors estimated using the number-averaged distance between collisions, 〈lp〉, for the characteristic void length scale increased with increasing Knudsen number, even though simulations in infinite cylinders confirmed the accuracy of the Bosanquet equation for all values of Kn. These unexpected changes in a geometric property of the void space become most apparent near the percolation void fraction (∼0.04). For example, the Knudsen tortuosity factor defined in this manner is 1.8 times larger than in the bulk regime for a solid with 0.10 void fraction. Even at high void fractions (∼0.42), the two extreme values of tortuosity factor differ by a factor of ∼1.4. These apparent effects of diffusion mechanism on tortuosities reflect the inaccurate use of number-averaged chord lengths when tracer reflections from random obstacles obey the Knudsen cosine law for diffuse reflection. A corrected length scale, first proposed by Derjaguin, leads to tortuosity factors independent of Kn for void fractions above 0.20; tortuosities differ by only 18{\%} and 4{\%} between Knudsen and bulk regimes even for void fractions of 0.10 and 0.15, respectively. The residual differences at void fractions below 0.10 arise from the increasingly serial nature of the remaining voids. Thus, a long-standing inconsistency between the defined geometric nature of tortuosity factors and their inexplicable dependence on diffusion mechanism is essentially resolved. In practice, these simulations allow the consistent and accurate use of tortuosity factors determined at any value of Kn for all diffusion regimes; they also prescribe, rigorously for void fractions above 0.15 and empirically for lower void fractions, the length scale relevant to diffusion in the Knudsen and transition diffusion regimes. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The performance of high-capacity Li/O2 batteries is limited by the high overpotential associated with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging. These losses have been attributed to sluggish charge transport within the solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2) discharge phase. Recent experiments have shown that use of Co3O4-containing Li/O2 electrodes enhances rechargeability, but the mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear, as are the general prospects for the promotion of the Li/O2 OER. Here first-principles calculations are combined with continuum-scale transport theory to build a multiscale model which demonstrates that the incorporation of trace Co into Li2O2 is a plausible mechanism for OER promotion. These calculations suggest that doping at equilibrium levels (tens of ppm) can enhance charge transport by shifting the balance of Li-ion vacancies and hole polarons. This mechanism could rationalize the improved rechargeability observed in Li/O2 electrodes containing Co. On the basis of a computational assessment of 22 additional dopants, we speculate that Ni may also be an effective OER promoter.},

Three types of cathode structures, including two-layer (gas diffusion layer (GDL) and catalyst layer (CL)), three-layer (GDL, micro porous layer (MPL) and CL), and multi-layer (GDL, CL, carbon based layer (CBL) and hydrophobic layers) structures were examined and compared in single-chamber MFCs (SCMFCs). The results showed that the three-layer (3L) cathode structures had lower water loss than other cathodes and had a high power density (501 mW/m2). The MPL in the 3L cathode structure prevented biofilm penetration into the cathode structure, which facilitated the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. The SCMFCs with the 3L cathodes had a low ohmic resistance (Rohmic: 26–34 $\Omega$) and a high cathode open circuit potential (OCP: 191 mV). The organic substrate removal efficiency (71–78{\%}) in the SCMFCs with 3L cathodes was higher than the SCMFCs with two-layer and multi-layer cathodes (49–68{\%}). This study demonstrated that inserting the MPL between CL and GDL substantially enhanced the overall electrical conduction, power generation and organic substrate removal in MFCs by reducing water loss and preventing biofilm infiltration into the cathode structure.},

In the current work we use the generalized Frumkin-Butler-Volmer (gFBV) equation to describe electrochemical reactions, an equation which, contrary to the classical Butler-Volmer approach, includes the effect of the double layer composition on the charge transfer rate. The gFBV theory is transparently coupled to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck ion transport theory to describe mass transfer in an electrochemical cell that consists of two parallel plate electrodes which sandwich a monovalent electrolyte. Based on this theoretical approach we present analytical relations that describe the complete transient response of the cell potential to a current step, from the first initial capacitive charging of the bulk electrolyte and the double layers all the way up to the steady-state of the system. We show that the transient response is characterized by three distinct time scales, namely; the capacitive charging of the bulk electrolyte at the fastest Debye time scale, and the formation of the double layers and the subsequent redistribution of ions in the bulk electrolyte at the longer harmonic and diffusion time scales, respectively.},

abstract = {Gas diffusion layer (GDL) is one of the critical components acting both as the functional as well as the support structure for membrane-electrode assembly in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The role of the GDL is very significant in the H2/air PEM fuel cell to make it commercially viable. A bibliometric analysis of the publications on the GDLs since 1992 shows a total of 400+ publications (>140 papers in the Journal of Power Sources alone) and reveals an exponential growth due to reasons that PEMFC promises a lot of potential as the future energy source for varied applications and hence its vital component GDL requires due innovative analysis and research. This paper is an attempt to pool together the published work on the GDLs and also to review the essential properties of the GDLs, the method of achieving each one of them, their characterization and the current status and future directions. The optimization of the functional properties of the GDLs is possible only by understanding the role of its key parameters such as structure, porosity, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, gas permeability, transport properties, water management and the surface morphology. This paper discusses them in detail to provide an insight into the structural parts that make the GDLs and also the processes that occur in the GDLs under service conditions and the characteristic properties. The required balance in the properties of the GDLs to facilitate the counter current flow of the gas and water is highlighted through its characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Capillary pressure versus saturation curves for drainage of a wetting phase were measured for several gas diffusion layers that are commonly used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. The technique employed can measure capillary pressure curves for both the total pore network and the pore network consisting of only hydrophilic pores. This enables the determination of capillary pressure curves directly relevant to the study of gas diffusion layer flooding. The overall distributions compared well with mercury intrusion data. It was found that the pore size distribution for the hydrophilic pores were similar in shape to the overall distribution for standard substrate materials. Materials with a microporous layer did not follow this trend and the microporous layer was found to be completely hydrophobic. Due to their similarity, the overall and hydrophilic capillary pressure curves for all materials could be correlated using a single Leverett J-function. The results were described by several standard capillary models, the parameters of which can be further used to predict the relative permeability of the phases.},

abstract = {The Li/oxygen battery may achieve a high practical specific energy as its theoretical specific energy is 11,400 Wh/kg Li assuming Li2O2 is the product. To help understand the physics of the Li/oxygen battery we present the first physics-based model that incorporates the major thermodynamic, transport, and kinetic processes. We obtain a good match between porous-electrode experiments and simulations by using an empirical fit to the resistance of the discharge products ?which include carbonates and oxides when using carbonate solvents? as a function of thickness that is obtained from flat-electrode experiments. The experiments and model indicate that the discharge products are electronically resistive, limiting their thickness to tens of nanometers and their volume fraction in one of our discharged porous electrodes to a few percent. Flat-electrode experiments, where pore clogging is impossible, show passivation similar to porous-electrode experiments and allow us to conclude that electrical passivation is the dominant capacity-limiting mechanism in our cells. Although in carbonate solvents Li2O2 is not the dominant discharge product, we argue that the implications of this model, ?i.e., electrical passivation by the discharge products limits the capacity? also apply if Li2O2 is the discharge product, as it is an intrinsic electronic insulator.},

abstract = {The effect of hydrophobic agent (PTFE) concentration in the microporous layer on the PEM fuel cell performance was investigated using mercury porosimetry, water permeation experiment, and electrochemical polarization technique. The mercury porosimetry and water permeation experiments indicated that PTFE increases the resistance of the water flow through the GDL due to a decrease of the MPL porosity and an increase of the volume fraction of hydrophobic pores. When air was used as an oxidant, a maximum fuel cell performance was obtained for a PTFE loading of 20wt.{\%}. The experimental polarization curves were quantitatively analyzed to determine the polarization resistances resulting from different physical and electrochemical processes in the PEM fuel cell. The polarization analysis indicated that the optimized PTFE content results in an effective water management (i.e., a balancing of water saturations in the catalyst layer and the gas diffusion layer), thereby improving the oxygen diffusion kinetics in the membrane-electrode assembly.},

abstract = {Porous electrodes composed of multiphase active materials are widely used in Li-ion batteries, but their dynamics are poorly understood. Two-phase models are largely empirical, and no models exist for three or more phases. Using a modified porous electrode theory based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we show that experimental phase behavior can be accurately predicted from free energy models, without artificially placing phase boundaries or fitting the open circuit voltage. First, we simulate lithium intercalation in porous iron phosphate, a popular two-phase cathode, and show that the zero-current voltage gap, sloping voltage plateau and under-estimated exchange currents all result from size-dependent nucleation and mosaic instability. Next, we simulate porous graphite, the standard anode with three stable phases, and reproduce experimentally observed fronts of color-changing phase transformations. These results provide a framework for physics-based design and control for electrochemical systems with complex thermodynamics.},

abstract = {The diffusion coefficient (D(O(2))), solubility (C(O(2))), and electrochemical behavior of oxygen reduction were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and transient amperometry on a Pt ultramicroelectrode in aqueous solutions containing various concentrations of NaOH (1-12 M). The results show that both D(O(2)) and C(O(2)) decrease as the solution viscosity (eta) increases significantly with increasing concentration of NaOH. The Stokes-Einstein relationship (D(O(2)) vs 1/eta) is followed, yielding a radius for the O(2) molecule, 2.8 A, that does not change over the concentration range of NaOH studied. From results reported previously for C(O(2)) in more dilute NaOH solutions and the new results here, the number of electrons, n, involved in the first step of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was found to change with the concentration of NaOH, from n = 2 at low NaOH concentrations (1-2 M) to n = 1 at high concentrations (>6 M), in line with the changing water activity. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was employed as a sensitive tool to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the product of the ORR in 10 M NaOH solution, O(2)(*-), as a function of potential. The SECM approach curves depend on the substrate bias and state of the Pt substrate surface, and the apparent rate constant for the redox couple of O(2)/O(2)(*-) is determined to be about 2.6 x 10(-4) cm/s in this solution.},

The dependencies of the Li-ion conduction (Rsl1), Li-ion solvation/desolvation
(Rsl2) and charge transfer (Rct) reactions on the SOC and anode potential
were evaluated. The results were compared with a dQ/dE vs. E curve
of graphite to analyze how the structural changes of graphite affect
the Li-ion insertion process. The charge transfer process was found
to be dependent on the SOC and anode potential. On the other hand,
Li-ion conduction and Li-ion solvation/desolvation processes did

abstract = {We study the effect of an inert supporting electrolyte on the steady-state ionic current through galvanic cells by solving the full Poisson–Nernst–Planck transport equation coupled to the generalized Frumkin–Butler–Volmer boundary equation for the electrochemical charge transfer at the electrodes. Consequently, the model presented here allows for non-zero space charge densities locally at the electrodes, thus extending the frequently used models based on the local electroneutrality condition by including diffuse layer (DL) effects. This extension is necessary since the DLs determine the ion concentration and electrical field at the reaction planes, which uniquely determine the charge transfer at the electrodes. In this work we present numerical results for systems which contain added inert supporting electrolyte using finite element discretization and compare those with semi-analytical results obtained using singular perturbation theory (limit of negligibly thin DLs). In case of negligibly thin DLs the presence of supporting electrolyte will introduce a limiting current below the classical diffusion-limiting current. Just as for systems without supporting electrolyte, the supporting electrolyte induced limiting current formally does not occur for systems having non-negligibly thin double DLs. For thin, however still finite, double layers this limit can still be seen as a steepening of the polarization curve for current vs. voltage.},

The investigation is performed on synthetic models with variation of q in the interval from 30 to 0.001. The influence of data quality is studied by applying data truncation from seven to two digits, as well as by introduction of a wild point. Experimental data measured on two actual dummy cells with q equal to 30 and 0.03, respectively, are also analyzed. The results are compared with those obtained by applying the algorithm of the wide-spread complex non-linear least-squares method, performed on zview software product.

@article{Yan2004,
abstract = {A study has been conducted on the effects of flow distributor and diffusion layer geometries and morphologies on the transport phenomena of reactant gas from flow channels to gas diffuser, and on the performance of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The emphasis of the analysis is placed on the effects of the cross-section of the channel of the anode flow distributor and the porosity of the gas-diffusion layer. By applying a two-dimensional mass transport model, the effects of the channel width fraction, $\lambda$=ℓc/ℓb, the channel number, N, the porosity of the diffuser layer, $\epsilon$, and the surface overpotential of the catalyst layer, $\eta$, on the resultant current density are investigated. The cell performance is evaluated by the predicted voltage–current density curves. It is disclosed that an increase in either $\lambda$, N or $\epsilon$ may lead to a better cell performance. At relatively low overpotential, better uniformity in current density distribution along the width of the cell (x-direction) can be attained. Based on the present results, a correlation of overpotentials is proposed, namely, $\eta$cr=0.165$\lambda$0.0935N0.2033$\epsilon$0.0856, which may serve as a guideline to justify the validity of a simplified one-dimensional model.},

@article{Melnick2001,
abstract = {We measured the time dependence of the impedance of the electro-oxidation
of methanol on polished polycrystalline platinum immersed in a solution
of sulfuric acid. The impedance data were fit to a model for a reaction
containing one adsorbed intermediate to obtain four physical parameters.
The time dependence of these parameters illuminates how a change
in the coverage of an adsorbed intermediate and the buildup of other
poisons affects the kinetics and mechanism of the electro-oxidation
of methanol. These results further support our conclusions based
on the potential dependence of the impedance, that is, four potential
regions exist between 200 and 800 mV vs RHE where a change in the
mechanism for the electro-oxidation of methanol occurs (Melnick,
R. E.; Palmore, G. T. R. J. Phys. Chem. B 2001, 105, 1012.). We hypothesize
that changes in the mechanism are caused by the presence of four
different species that contain oxygen, each belonging to a specific
potential region with the more reactive species at higher potentials.
We have combined impedance data from potential-dependent studies
with impedance data that are time dependent to construct a qualitative
model of this reaction. This model describes the rate of charge transfer
for the electro-oxidation of methanol as a function of potential
and coverage of adsorbed intermediate. The result is a model that
predicts the behavior of this reaction at a platinum electrode, which
is in agreement with that observed experimentally by impedance spectroscopy,
chronoamperometry, and cyclic voltammetry.},

abstract = {Dynamics of performance degradation of a PEM fuel cell operating in galvanostatic regime is investigated. Experiments enable to distinguish the three phases of cell degradation: the phase of stable operation, the phase of slow decrease of cell voltage Vcell with time and the phase of Vcell rapid fall. Experiments suggest that the duration of stable operation phase depends on oxygen stoichiometric ratio. To explain this we assume that (i) local degradation interrupts generation of local current and (ii) the rate of local degradation is a jump function of local current density. Dynamics of performance degradation is then determined by the degradation wave, which propagates in the along-the-channel direction towards the channel outlet. Analysis of wave properties enables to explain qualitatively the experimental dependence of cell voltage on time. The degradation of fuel cell performance may thus follow the universal scenario, which includes propagation of the degradation wave. Actual physical mechanism of local current interruption determines the time scales in this scenario.},

abstract = {Oxygen electroreduction (ORR) on Pt-nanoclusters activated electrodes, based on different microporous-mesoporous carbon supports, were studied in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using cyclic voltammetry, rotating disc electrode (RDE), and impedance methods. The C(Mo2C) carbon supports with variable specific surface area, microporosity-mesoporosity, good electrical conductivity and corrosion stability at positive potentials were prepared from Mo2C at 600 °C and 800 °C using chlorination synthesis method. Pt-nanoclusters were deposited onto/into carbons using sodium borohydride reduction method. XRD, XRF, XPS, SEM-EDX, and HRTEM data confirm that catalysts under study are free from chlorine, chloride ions, and other residuals of raw materials, and have highly porous hierarchical structure with homogenously dispersed Pt-nanoclusters. RDE data show that the kinetic current densities are higher and half-wave potentials are more positive for Pt-C(Mo 2C)800 °C than for Pt-C(Mo2C)600 °C in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The limiting diffusion currents are independent of the catalyst composition used due to the proceeding of ORR process in the outer-diffusion mode. Analysis of impedance data demonstrated nearly capacitive behaviour in low ac frequency region, explained by quick cathodic electroreduction of oxygen followed by slow electrical double-layer formation step limited by adsorption of ions and intermediates at/inside microporous-mesoporous C(Mo2C) and Pt-nanocluster modified electrodes. High series and parallel capacitance values (100-250 F g -1) have been established, attractive also for hybrid supercapacitor applications. High frequency series resistance values are higher for more amorphous C(Mo2C)600 °C than for C(Mo2C)800 °C supported electrode. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

solving a system of time dependent nonlinear coupled partial differential

the interface between a cell and a sensor device. The densities and

dimension on the order of 10(-4) so the Fourier-Bessel series can
be approximated by elementary functions. The time development of
the system is characterized by two time constants, $\tau$c and $\tau$g.
The constant $\tau$c describes the approach to the stationary state
of the total charge and the potential. $\tau$c is several orders
of magnitude smaller than the geometry-dependent constant $\tau$g,
which is on the order of 10 ms characterizing the transition to the
stationary state of the single ion densities.},

The implemented approach is founded on Landauer formalism coupled to electron propagator theory (Green-Keldysh functions formalism) of solving the Dyson equation for molecular junction. The electron transfer rate calculation algorithm implementing quantum chemistry computational software output is proposed. The conductance through a single molecular orbital is found to be equal to a quantum of conductance, 2e2/h. The existence of the maximal value of electron transfer rate through a single molecular orbital is proposed, ($\pi$2/4h)$\Gamma$L$\Gamma$RF, whose order-of-magnitude estimate is 1011–1013s−1.},

abstract = {We report a novel method for performance recovery of direct methanol fuel cells. Lowering of air flow rate below a critical value turns the cell into bifunctional regime, when the oxygen-rich part of the cell generates current while the rest part works in electrolysis mode (electrolytic domain). Upon restoring the normal (super-critical) air flow rate, the galvanic performance of the electrolytic domain increases. This recovery effect is presumably attributed to Pt surface cleaning on the cathode with the simultaneous increase in catalyst utilization on the anode.},

abstract = {Understanding the lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) electrochemical reaction
is of importance to improve reaction kinetics, efficiency, and mitigate
parasitic reactions, which links to the strategy of enhanced Li-O2
battery performance. Many in situ and ex situ analyses have been
reported to address chemical species of reduction intermediate and
products, whereas details of the dynamic Li-O2 reaction have not
as yet been fully unraveled. For this purpose, visual imaging can
provide straightforward evidence, formation and decomposition of
products, during the Li-O2 electrochemical reaction. Here, we present
real-time and in situ views of the Li-O2 reaction using electrochemical
atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM). Details of the reaction process
can be observed at nano-/micrometer scale on a highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite (HOPG) electrode with lithium ion-containing tetraglyme,
representative of the carbon cathode and ether-based electrolyte
extensively employed in the Li-O2 battery. Upon oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR), rapid growth of nanoplates, having axial diameter
of hundreds of nanometers, length of micrometers, and {\~{}}5 nm thickness,
at a step edge of HOPG can be observed, which eventually forms a
lithium peroxide (Li2O2) film. This Li2O2 film is decomposed during
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), for which the decomposition
potential is related to a thickness. There is no evidence of byproduct
analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after first reduction
and oxidation reaction. However, further cycles provide unintended
products such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium acetate, and
fluorine-related species with irregular morphology due to the degradation
of HOPG electrode, tetraglyme, and lithium salt. These observations
provide the first visualization of Li-O2 reaction process and morphological
information of Li2O2, which can allow one to build strategies to
prepare the optimum conditions for the Li-O2 battery.},

@article{Johnson2014,
abstract = {When lithium–oxygen batteries discharge, O2 is reduced at the cathode to form solid Li2O2. Understanding the fundamental mechanism of O2 reduction in aprotic solvents is therefore essential to realizing their technological potential. Two different models have been proposed for Li2O2 formation, involving either solution or electrode surface routes. Here, we describe a single unified mechanism, which, unlike previous models, can explain O2 reduction across the whole range of solvents and for which the two previous models are limiting cases. We observe that the solvent influences O2 reduction through its effect on the solubility of LiO2, or, more precisely, the free energy of the reaction LiO2* ⇌ Li(sol)+ + O2−(sol) + ion pairs + higher aggregates (clusters). The unified mechanism shows that low-donor-number solvents are likely to lead to premature cell death, and that the future direction of research for lithium–oxygen batteries should focus on the search for new, stable, high-donor-number electrolytes, because they can support higher capacities and can better sustain discharge.},

Understanding and controlling the nucleation and morphological evolution of Li2O2 particles upon discharge is key to achieving high volumetric energy densities. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the discharge product formed in Li?O2 batteries on electrodes composed of carpets of aligned carbon nanotubes. At low discharge rates, Li2O2 particles form first as stacked thin plates, ?10 nm in thickness, which spontaneously splay so that secondary nucleation of new plates eventually leads to the development of a particle with a toroidal shape. Li2O2 crystallites have large (001) crystal faces consistent with the theoretical Wulff shape and appear to grow by a layer-by-layer mechanism. In contrast, at high discharge rates, copious nucleation of equiaxed Li2O2 particles precedes growth of discs and toroids.},

abstract = {Motivated by development of lithium-ion batteries, we study the structure
and dynamics of LiBF(4) in pure and mixed solvents with various salt
concentrations. For this purpose, we have developed force field models
for ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate,
and dimethoxyethane. We find that Li(+) is preferentially solvated
by the cyclic and more polar component of the mixtures, as the electrostatic
interaction overcomes possible steric hindrances. The cation coordination
number decreases from 6 to 5 with increasing salt concentration due
to formation of ion-pairs. The uniform decline of the diffusion coefficients
of the two ions is disrupted at mixture compositions that perturb
the ion-pair interaction. We show that the Stokes{\{}'{\}} model of diffusion
can be applied to the very small Li(+) ion, provided that the size
of the first solvation shell is properly taken into consideration.
The strong coordination of the ions by the polar, cyclic components
of the solvent mixtures established in our simulations suggests that
the less polar linear component can be optimized in order to reduce
electrolyte viscosity and to achieve high electrical conductivity.},

The influence of MEA fabrication parameters like electrode pressing or annealing on the performance of hydrogen fuel cells was studied by single cell measurements with H2/O2 operation. Toray paper and carbon cloth as gas diffusion layer (GDL) materials were compared and the composition of electrode inks was optimized with regard to most favorable fuel cell performance. Commercial E-TEK catalyst was used on the anode and cathode with Pt loadings of 0.4 and 0.6mg/cm2, respectively. The MEA with best performance delivered approximately 0.58W/cm2, at 65°C cell temperature, 80°C anode humidification, dry cathode and ambient pressure on both electrodes. The results show, that changing electrode compositions or the use of different materials with same functionality (e.g. different GDLs), have a larger effect on fuel cell performance than changing preparation parameters like hot pressing or spraying conditions, studied in previous work.},

Adding a micro porous layer to traditional gas diffusion layer (GDL) can enhance the ability of water management, and therefore achieve better cell performance and higher limiting current density. For the effects of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), either too high or too low content will deteriorate the performance of fuel cells. If the FEP content in the GDL is too high, indicating the GDL with a quite small pore size, the fuel gas will be difficult to diffuse in the GDL. If the content is too low, the water generated in the cell cannot be effectively removed. It is disclosed by the present experiments that when using air as cathode oxidant at an operating voltage above 0.6V, the best performance can be achieved by using a GDL with 10{\%} FEP content in the carbon paper and 20{\%} content in the micro porous layer. The Vulcan XC-72R carbon loading of 1mg/cm2 in the micro porous layer is sufficiently high to obtain the maximum performance.},

abstract = {As the contribution of electricity generated from renewable sources (wind, wave and solar) grows, the inherent intermittency of supply from such generating technologies must be addressed by a step-change in energy storage. Furthermore, the continuously developing demands of contemporary applications require the design of versatile energy-storage/power supply systems offering wide ranges of power density and energy density. As no single energy-storage technology has this capability, systems will comprise combinations of technologies such as electrochemical supercapacitors, flow batteries, lithium-ion batteries, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and kinetic energy storage. The evolution of the electrochemical supercapacitor is largely dependent on the development of optimised electrode materials (tailored to the chosen electrolyte) and electrolytes. Similarly, the development of lithium-ion battery technology requires fundamental research in materials science aimed at delivering new electrodes and electrolytes. Lithium-ion technology has significant potential, and a step-change is required in order to promote the technology from the portable electronics market into high-duty applications. Flow-battery development is largely concerned with safety and operability. However, opportunities exist to improve electrode technology yielding larger power densities. The main barriers to overcome with regard to the development of SMES technology are those related to high-temperature superconductors in terms of their granular, anisotropic nature. Materials development is essential for the successful evolution of flywheel technology.

abstract = {Sparsely populated, vertically aligned nitrogen doped carbon nanotube
arrays (CNTAs) with dislocated-graphene stacking were grown directly
on carbon fiber papers and investigated as hierarchical air cathodes
in hybrid Li-air batteries with aqueous catholytes. The CNTAs were
made with electrodeposited Ni nanocatalysts, followed by plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition. The thus obtained CNTAs can reach a population
number density as low as 107 per cm2 on the carbon fibers, achieving
an extremely high porosity of over 99{\%} for the active layer in the
cathode. The sparse CNTAs not only provide effective pathways for
the reacting species, but also show a significantly high catalytic
activity, which is found to be comparable to that of a supported
Pt electrocatalyst. The high activity of the CNTAs is attributed
to the rich graphene edges exposed on the CNT surface and nitrogen
doping. Hybrid Li-air batteries with such cathodes have shown a consistent
discharging capacity of 710 mA h g−1 and a specific energy of 2057
W h kg−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2. Stable charge–discharge cycling at 0.5 mA
cm−2 showed an average potential difference of 1.35 V, indicative
of a relatively small overpotential and high round trip efficiency
(71{\%}). Furthermore, the hybrid Li-air battery based on the hierarchical
cathode can reach a power density as high as 10.4 mW cm−2.},

abstract = {Porous metal hydride electrodes of the alloy MmNi3.5-3.7Co 0.7-0.8 Mn0.3-0.4Al0.3-0.4 have been characterized by means of impedance spectroscopy. A mathematical model for the impedance response, including effects of diffusion of hydrogen, surface kinetics, conductivity in the metal phase and the solution phase, as well as a continuous, lognormal, particle size distribution, was implemented and fitted to the experimental results by application of a least square fitting routine. The model is based on physical parameters, thus avoiding problems related to the conventional interpretation of impedance spectra in terms of equivalent circuits. Very good agreement between experimental results and model results was obtained for a wide range of frequencies, indicating that physical parameters to a great extent can be determined under realistic operating conditions. The latter was confirmed by independent measurements of the variation in open circuit voltage with respect to the state of charge of the electrode. The model provides an improved methodology for the determination of diffusion coefficients based on electrochemical impedance data. Furthermore, the model can be applied for parametric studies of metal hydride electrodes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The optimal design of the cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) is not only to attain better cell performance, but also to achieve better water management for the DMFC system. In this work, the effects of both the PTFE loading in the cathode backing layer (BL) as well as in the micro-porous layer (MPL) and the carbon loading in the MPL on both water transport and cell performance were investigated experimentally. The experimental data showed that with the presence of a hydrophobic MPL in the GDL, the water-crossover flux through the membrane decreased slightly with increasing the PTFE loading in the BL. However, a higher PTFE loading in the BL not only lowered cell performance, but also resulted in an unstable discharging process. It was also found that the PTFE loading in the MPL had little effect on the water-crossover flux, but its effect on cell performance was substantial: the 40-wt{\%} PTFE loading in the MPL was found to be the optimal value to achieve the best performance. The experimental results further showed that increasing the carbon loading in the MPL significantly lowered the water-crossover flux, but a too high carbon loading would decrease the cell performance as the result of the increased oxygen transport resistance; the 2.0-mgCcm−2 carbon loading was found to exhibit the best performance.},

abstract = {Supercapacitors have exceptional power density and cyclability but
smaller energy density than batteries. Their energy density can be
increased using ionic liquids and electrodes with subnanometre pores,
but this tends to reduce their power density and compromise the key
advantage of supercapacitors. To help address this issue through
material optimization, here we unravel the mechanisms of charging
subnanometre pores with ionic liquids using molecular dynamics simulations,
navigated by a phenomenological model. We show that charging of ionophilic
pores is a diffusive process, often accompanied by overfilling followed
by de-filling. In sharp contrast to conventional expectations, charging
is fast because ion diffusion during charging can be an order of
magnitude faster than in the bulk, and charging itself is accelerated
by the onset of collective modes. Further acceleration can be achieved
using ionophobic pores by eliminating overfilling/de-filling and
thus leading to charging behaviour qualitatively different from that
in conventional, ionophilic pores.},

abstract = {Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is a novel electrode material that can be used in both Li ion and Na ion batteries (LIBs and NIBs). The long- and short-range structural changes and ionic and electronic mobility of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 as a positive electrode in a NIB have been investigated with electrochemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-resolution 23Na and 31P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The 23Na NMR spectra and XRD refinements show that the Na ions are removed nonselectively from the two distinct Na sites, the fully occupied Na1 site and the partially occupied Na2 site, at least at the beginning of charge. Anisotropic changes in lattice parameters of the cycled Na3V2(PO4)2F3 electrode upon charge have been observed, where a (= b) continues to increase and c decreases, indicative of solid-solution processes. A noticeable decrease in the cell volume between 0.6 Na and 1 Na is observed along with a discontinuity in the 23Na hyperfine shift between 0.9 and 1.0 Na extraction, which we suggest is due to a rearrangement of unpaired electrons within the vanadium t2g orbitals. The Na ion mobility increases steadily on charging as more Na vacancies are formed, and coalescence of the resonances from the two Na sites is observed when 0.9 Na is removed, indicating a Na1−Na2 hopping (two-site exchange) rate of ≥4.6 kHz. This rapid Na motion must in part be responsible for the good rate performance of this electrode material. The 31P NMR spectra are complex, the shifts of the two crystallograpically distinct sites being sensitive to both local Na cation ordering on the Na2 site in the as-synthesized material, the presence of oxidized (V4+) defects in the structure, and the changes of cation and electronic mobility on Na extraction. This study shows how NMR spectroscopy complemented by XRD can be used to provide insight into the mechanism of Na extraction from Na3V2(PO4)2F3 when used in a NIB.},

abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wang2013c,
abstract = {With the development of renewable energy and electrified transportation,
electrochemical energy storage will be more important in the future
than it has ever been in the past. Although lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) are traditionally considered to be the most likeliest candidate
thanks to their relatively long cycle life and high energy efficiency,
their limited energy density as well as cost are still causing a
bottleneck for their long-term application. Alternatively, metal-air
batteries have been proposed as a very promising large-scale electricity
storage technology with the replacement of the intercalation reaction
mechanism by the catalytic redox reaction of a light weight metal-oxygen
couple. Generally, based on the electrolyte, these metal-air batteries
can be divided into aqueous and nonaqueous systems, corresponding
to two typical batteries of Zn-air and Li-air, respectively. The
prominent feature of both batteries are their extremely high theoretical
energy density, especially for nonaqueous Li-air batteries, which
far exceeds the best that can be achieved with LIBs. In this review,
we focus on the major obstacle of sluggish kinetics of the cathode
in both batteries, and summarize the fundamentals and recent advances
related to the oxygen catalyst materials. According to the electrolyte,
the aqueous and nonaqueous electrocatalytic mechanisms of the oxygen
reduction and evolution reactions are discussed. Subsequently, seven
groups of oxygen catalysts, which have played catalytic roles in
both systems, are selectively reviewed, including transition metal
oxides (single-metal oxides and mixed-metal oxides), functional carbon
materials (nanostructured carbons and doped carbons), metal oxide-nanocarbon
hybrid materials, metal-nitrogen complexes (non-pyrolyzed and pyrolyzed),
transition metal nitrides, conductive polymers, and precious metals
(alloys). Nonaqueous systems have the advantages of energy density
and rechargeability over aqueous systems and have gradually become
the research focus of metal-air batteries. However, there are considerable
challenges beyond catalysts from aqueous to nonaqueous electrolytes,
which are also discussed in this review. Finally, several future
research directions are proposed based on the results achieved in
this field, with emphasis on nonaqueous Li-air batteries.},

among all the perovskites examined. Further exploration of Cr-based
catalysts showed that Cr nanoparticles (Cr NP) with an average particle
size of 40 nm, having oxidized surfaces, had comparable surface area
activities to LaCrO3 but much greater mass activities. Unlike Pt/C
and Ru/C that promote electrolyte oxidation in addition to Li2O2
oxidation, no evidence of enhanced electrolyte oxidation was found

The effects of changes in electrolyte concentration, temperature and partial pressure of oxygen were investigated. The ratio of the solubility of oxygen in the electrolyte solutions to that in pure water decreases as the concentration of the electrolyte increases but is essentially independent of both temperature (over the range 298-348 K) and the oxygen partial pressure (over the range 0.1 - 1.0 atm). Empirical relationships for this solubility ratio as a function of the electrolyte concentration and temperature were developed. The predictions made using these relationships are found to be superior to the alternative methods suggested in the literature, particularly for those conditions frequently found in hydrometallurgical systems, namely at high electrolyte concentrations. The significance of changes in the solubility of oxygen in aqueous electrolyte solutions is briefly discussed with particular reference to the hydrometallurgical implications.},

abstract = {A carbon-filled gas diffusion layer (CFGDL), which is in the configuration similar to conventional carbon cloth gas diffusion layer (GDL) coated with carbon layer on both faces, was investigated and compared with conventional carbon paper-based single-layer and dual-layer GDLs. Like the carbon cloth GDL, CFGDL has presented superior performances over the single-layer or dual-layer GDL in all three polarization (activation, ohmic and concentration) controlled regions under electrochemical characterizations (steady-state polarization and electrochemical impedance spectra). The results from SEM showed that CFGDL has the same thickness of 0.11mm as that of single-layer GDL, while dual-layer GDL has a thickness of 0.18mm. The fully filled carbon paper with carbon/PTFE filler, as seen in the SEM image, displayed good support for the catalyst layer and electrolyte phase, allowing good electrical contact between the GDL/catalyst/membrane and GDL/flow field plate to be achieved. From porosimetry analysis, CFGDL presented a lower porosity of 67{\%} and a much smaller average pore diameter of 4.7$\mu$m compared to the single-layer GDL (porosity of 77{\%} and pore diameter of 35.8$\mu$m) and dual-layer GDL (porosity of 73{\%} and pore diameter of 25.5$\mu$m); however, it also gave the largest limiting current density, which reflects the improvement in mass transportation. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the fast removal of micro-water droplets formed in the CFGDL structure of the electrode.},

Due to large MOR overpotential on the cathode side, the rate of this reaction is determined by the potential-independent methanol adsorption on the catalyst surface. According to the model, at all methanol concentrations, the presence of methanol in the CCL affects the low-frequency part of the spectrum. In addition, at high methanol concentration, a MOR-dominated domain (virtual anode) forms at the membrane interface. This domain manifests itself as a weakly pronounced second high-frequency arc.

abstract = {Understanding the thermal stability of major reaction products, Li2O2 (space group P63/mmc) and Li2O (space group Fm3m) is critical to improve the safety characteristics of Li-air batteries. The changes in the crystal structure and surface chemistry of Li2O2 and Li2O were examined as a function of temperature via in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Significant decreases in the lattice parameters and the c/a ratio of Li2O2 were found at 280◦C and higher. These structural changes can be attributed to the transformation of Li2O2 to Li2O2-$\delta$, which is supported by density functional theory calculations. Upon further heating to 700◦C, a lithium-deficient Li2-$\delta$Ophase appeared at 300◦Cand gradually became stoichiometric upon further heating to∼550◦C. XPS measurements of Li2O2 revealed that Li2Oappeared on the surface starting at 250◦C, which is in agreement with the onset temperature of phase transformation as detected by XRD. In addition, the growth of Li2CO3 on the surface was found at 250◦C, which can be attributed to chemical reactions between Li2O2/Li2O and carbon-containing species (e.g. hydrocarbons) present in the XPS chamber. This finding highlights the challenges of developing stable carbon-based oxygen electrode for Li-air batteries. ©},

the superoxide requires a much lower nucleation energy than the peroxide,

development of new EIS techniques to reduce measurement time. For
this purpose, various forms of multisine EIS techniques were first
developed via a noise signal synthesized by mixing ac waves of various
frequencies, followed by fast Fourier transform of the signal and
the resulting current. Subsequently, an entirely new concept was
introduced in which true white noise was used as an excitation source,
followed by Fourier transform of both excitation and response signals.
Section 2 describes novel applications of the newly developed techniques
to time-resolved impedance measurements as well as to impedance imaging.
Section 3 is devoted to recent applications of EIS techniques, specifically
traditional measurements in various fields with a special emphasis

@article{Schneider2007,
abstract = {The effect of oxygen depletion along the cathode flow channels on
the local impedance response of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC)
operated on air and pure hydrogen was investigated using a novel
experimental approach. The method combines the use of sectioned electrodes
and local ac measurements in PEFCs. The results shown here give experimental
proof that oxygen concentration oscillations in the cathode gas channels
generated as a consequence of ac current flow evoke the formation
of a low frequency capacitive loop in local H-2/air-PEFC impedance
spectra in downstream parts of the flow field. The loop shows positive
or negative real parts at low frequencies depending on the air stoichiometry.
The loop is not observed in the local spectrum when the ac current
is applied locally and, consequently, the impact of upstream processes
on the local impedance response is excluded. A mechanistic description
of the processes occurring during ac measurements in H-2/air-PEFCs
was developed and validated by experiments. The results show that
processes occurring along the flow channels of a PEFC cannot be excluded
from the interpretation of PEFC impedance spectra even at rather
high air stoichiometries and are in fact the most important phenomena
at low modulation frequencies (f(mod)< 10 Hz).},

of air electrodes. The battery electrochemistry and catalytic mechanism
of oxygen reduction reactions are discussed on the basis of aqueous
and organic electrolytes. Four groups of extensively studied catalysts
for the cathode oxygen reduction/evolution are selectively surveyed
from materials chemistry to electrode properties and battery application:
Pt and Pt-based alloys (e.g., PtAu nanoparticles), carbonaceous materials
(e.g., graphene nanosheets), transition-metal oxides (e.g., Mn-based
spinels and perovskites), and inorganic-organic composites (e.g.,
metal macrocycle derivatives). The design and optimization of air-electrode
structure are also outlined. Furthermore, remarks on the challenges
and perspectives of research directions are proposed for further
development of metal-air batteries (219 references).},

abstract = {Our 1D+1D model of DMFC reveals a new effect. At infinitely small total current in the cell, near the channel inlet forms a “bridge”, a narrow region with finite local current density. The bridge short-circuits the electrodes, thus reducing cell open-circuit voltage. In our previous work the effect is described for the case of equal methanol $\lambda$a and oxygen $\lambda$c stoichiometries. In this Letter, we analyze the general case of arbitrary $\lambda$a and $\lambda$c. In the case of $\lambda$a>$\lambda$c current may occupy finite domain of the cell surface. Asymptotic solution for the case of $\lambda$a≫$\lambda$c shows, that the size of this domain is proportional to oxygen stoichiometry. In the opposite limit of $\lambda$a≪$\lambda$c local current exponentially decreases with the distance along the channel. Asymptotic solutions suggest that the bridge forms regardless of the relationship between $\lambda$a and $\lambda$c. In all cases local current density in the bridge increases with the rate of methanol crossover and decreases with the growth of the “rate-determining” stoichiometry. The expression for voltage loss at open-circuit is derived.},

abstract = {High density electrochemical energy storage is of central importance for mobile power applications. The relatively low energy density and high cost associated with the current approaches to electrochemical energy storage, including various battery and supercapacitor technologies, have been the main hurdles to its more widespread application. Herein we report a new family of silicide based anode materials for high energy density metal-air primary batteries. Several intrinsic features of silicide materials including high electron capacity, high conductivity and high operating voltage make them an excellent class of materials for very high density energy storage. We show that various silicide anodes (Mg2Si, TiSi2, CoSi2 and VSi2) can exhibit excellent electrochemical performance with unparalleled capacity in both thin films and bulk powder pellet forms. With further optimization, silicide materials can promise a new battery family with ultra-high anode capacity and can open up exciting opportunities for future mobile power applications.},

It follows from this assumption that there is no multiscaling issue in DLA and there is only a single fractal dimensionDfor all length scales. We check our assumption self-consistently by calculating the particle-density distribution with a measured Pðr=RdepÞ function on an ensemble with 1000 clusters of 5107 particles each. We also show that a nontrivial multiscaling function DðxÞ can be obtained only when small clusters (N<10 000) are used to calculate DðxÞ. Hence, multiscaling is a finite-size effect and is not intrinsic to DLA.},

abstract = {The electrical double layer characteristics and oxygen electroreduction
kinetics in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution has been studied at micromesoporous
tungsten carbide derived carbon C(WC) electrodes. Carbon powders
with various specific surface areas (1280-2116 m2 g -1) have been
prepared from WC at chlorination temperatures 900 °C, 1000 °C and
1100 °C. The porous structure of carbon substrate was characterised
using nitrogen sorption, X-ray diffraction, high resolution TEM,
electron energy loss spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction
and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
methods. Cyclic voltammograms at various potential scan rates from
2 to 70 mV s -1, and rotating disc electrode data at rotation velocities
from 0 to 3000 rev min-1, were measured within the region of potentials
from +0.4 V to -0.6 V vs. Hg|Hg2SO4|sat.K2SO 4 in H2O (MSE). At E
> -0.2 V, the electroreduction of oxygen is mainly limited by the
charge transfer step, and at -0.6 V < E < -0.2 V, by the mixed kinetics.
The oxygen electroreduction mainly proceeds through the peroxide
formation intermediate step on all electrodes studied. Despite of
that the electrodes tested were very stable during the electrochemical
experiment, indicating that the C(WC) is a suitable catalyst support
material for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. The electroreduction
rate of oxygen depends strongly on the structure (graphitisation
level) of carbide derived carbon used for preparation of an electrode
and the oxygen reduction overvoltage decreases in the order C(WC)
1100 °C > C(WC) 1000 °C > C(WC) 900 °C. Very high low-frequency capacitance
values, independent of alternative current (ac) frequency at f <
0.1 Hz, have been established for C(WC) 1100 °C, demonstrating that
at ac f → 0, mainly pseudocapacitive behaviour with adsorption limited
step of reaction intermediates has been observed. © 2012 Elsevier

@article{Bandarenka2013,
abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the oldest
electroanalytical techniques. With respect to the investigation of
the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, it has gained wide popularity
as a non-destructive, sensitive and highly informative method. A
particularly attractive advantage is that it provides a unique opportunity
to distinguish contributions from different processes which take
place simultaneously at the electrode surface. During the past decade,
considerable progress has been made in the field of impedance spectroscopy
to advance data acquisition, modelling and spectra analysis. EIS
has evolved from slow data acquisition procedures with semi-quantitative
interpretation to innovative methodologies which allow simple operation
and accurate analysis using hundreds or even thousands of spectra;
these spectra can often be recorded as a result of a single experiment.
Impedance spectroscopy is nowadays widely combined with other techniques,
with successful application in areas ranging from analytical and
physical chemistry to localized impedance microscopies. The focus
of this review is on recent experimental and theoretical achievements
in the characterisation of the interfaces between metal electrodes
and aqueous electrolytes using EIS. Some key challenges to further
increase the informative power of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
are also outlined.},

impedance is presented and analyzed. A strong nonlinear temperature
correlation is shown for all frequency ranges. Although the ohmic
resistance is nearly unaffected by variation in SOC, the mass transport
impedance reduces from 100{\%} to 60{\%} SOC and increases significantly
again for lower SOCs. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

the poor crystallinity of the sample. In addition, the commonly known

to validate the possible existence of these newly predicted Li2O2

@article{Bar-Ziv2001,
abstract = {The motivation for this review is the need to understand the interdependence of porous structure and reactivity of highly porous carbonaceous materials during oxidation. These materials can be oxidized in three regimes: regime I, kinetically controlled conditions; regime II, partial diffusion-controlled conditions; regime III, diffusion controlled conditions. Since the emphasis here is on the porous structure and its influence on reactivity, conditions where transport processes are dominant were not included for they mask the view of interest. Therefore, the review discusses only physicochemical processes occurring during oxidation of highly porous chars in regime I. Furthermore, reactivity is influenced by many factors, such as catalysis, volatile matter, and water content. To avoid the effect of these factors, highly porous synthetic chars with nothing but elemental carbon and residual hydrogen and oxygen was chosen. Mainly, we discuss a commercial product known as Spherocarb which consists of spherica l particles with specific surface area of about 1000 m2 g-1 and porosity of about 0.6. These particles are well defined and reproducible in their properties. They serve well as model materials for various synthetic chars, coal chars, and other carbonaceous materials. The review presents in a systematic manner macroscopic properties and processes that shed light on different aspects of porosity and reactivity. These are presented both from experimental observation as well as modeling view. An attempt was made to present a porous structure model that can reconstruct all available experimental data on these particles during oxidation. In the review the following processes and properties are discussed: shrinkage, fragmentation, and porosity. All are directly connected to porous structure and reactivity. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Transition metal phosphates such as LiFePO(4) have been recognized
as very promising electrodes for lithium-ion batteries because of
their energy storage capacity combined with electrochemical and thermal
stability. A key issue in these materials is to unravel the factors
governing electron and ion transport within the lattice. Lithium
extraction from LiFePO(4) results in a two-phase mixture with FePO(4)
that limits the power characteristics owing to the low mobility of
the phase boundary. This boundary is a consequence of low solubility
of the parent phases, and its mobility is impeded by slow migration
of the charge carriers. In principle, these limitations could be
diminished in a solid solution, Li(x)FePO(4). Here, we show that
electron delocalization in the solid solution phases formed at elevated
temperature is due to rapid small polaron hopping and is unrelated
to consideration of the band gap. We give the first experimental
evidence for a strong correlation between electron and lithium delocalization
events that suggests they are coupled. Furthermore, the exquisite
frequency sensitivity of M{\"{o}}ssbauer measurements provides direct
insight into the electron hopping rate.},

studied conducting polymers. At the same time, ac-electrogravimetry
has been used as a powerful technique for different polymer films
but in general for slow perturbation rates. Two reasons for that:
on the one hand, high frequency mass transfer responses are not expected
and on the other hand, the electronic interfaces dedicated for ac-electrogravimetry
are not prepared to follow, without distortion, high rate frequency
shifts, faster than a few hertz. This paper shows that high ionic
transfer responses can be detected by using a new ac-electrogravimetry
concept. The experiments conducted with PANI tried to verify whether
high frequency responses in conducting polymers are possible or not.
The main interest of the new device is to reach the high frequency
values directly and to demonstrate an ionic transfer contribution

The electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were evaluated by polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in an alkaline electrolyte. The binary-support electrode exhibits better performance than the single-support electrode, and the best performance is obtained when the mass ratio of carbon nanotubes and active carbon is 50:50. The results from the electrode kinetic parameters indicate that the introduction of carbon nanotubes as a secondary support provides high accessible surface area, good electronic conductivity, and fast ORR kinetics. Furthermore, the effect of CNT support on the electrocatalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles for binary-support electrodes was also investigated by different loading-reduction methods. The electrocatalytic activity of the binary-support electrodes is improved dramatically by Pt loading on CNT carbon support, even at very low Pt loading. Additionally, the EIS analysis results indicate that the process of ORR may be controlled by diffusion of oxygen in the electrode thin film for binary-support electrodes with or without Pt catalyst.},

@article{Goodenough2013,
abstract = {Each cell of a battery stores electrical energy as chemical energy
in two electrodes, a reductant (anode) and an oxidant (cathode),
separated by an electrolyte that transfers the ionic component of
the chemical reaction inside the cell and forces the electronic component
outside the battery. The output on discharge is an external electronic
current I at a voltage V for a time $\Delta$t. The chemical reaction
of a rechargeable battery must be reversible on the application of
a charging I and V. Critical parameters of a rechargeable battery
are safety, density of energy that can be stored at a specific power
input and retrieved at a specific power output, cycle and shelf life,
storage efficiency, and cost of fabrication. Conventional ambient-temperature
rechargeable batteries have solid electrodes and a liquid electrolyte.
The positive electrode (cathode) consists of a host framework into
which the mobile (working) cation is inserted reversibly over a finite
solid-solution range. The solid-solution range, which is reduced
at higher current by the rate of transfer of the working ion across
electrode/electrolyte interfaces and within a host, limits the amount
of charge per electrode formula unit that can be transferred over
the time $\Delta$t = $\Delta$t(I). Moreover, the difference between
energies of the LUMO and the HOMO of the electrolyte, i.e., electrolyte
window, determines the maximum voltage for a long shelf and cycle
life. The maximum stable voltage with an aqueous electrolyte is 1.5
V; the Li-ion rechargeable battery uses an organic electrolyte with
a larger window, which increase the density of stored energy for
a given $\Delta$t. Anode or cathode electrochemical potentials outside
the electrolyte window can increase V, but they require formation
of a passivating surface layer that must be permeable to Li(+) and
capable of adapting rapidly to the changing electrode surface area
as the electrode changes volume during cycling. A passivating surface
layer adds to the impedance of the Li(+) transfer across the electrode/electrolyte
interface and lowers the cycle life of a battery cell. Moreover,
formation of a passivation layer on the anode robs Li from the cathode
irreversibly on an initial charge, further lowering the reversible
$\Delta$t. These problems plus the cost of quality control of manufacturing
plague development of Li-ion rechargeable batteries that can compete
with the internal combustion engine for powering electric cars and
that can provide the needed low-cost storage of electrical energy
generated by renewable wind and/or solar energy. Chemists are contributing
to incremental improvements of the conventional strategy by investigating
and controlling electrode passivation layers, improving the rate
of Li(+) transfer across electrode/electrolyte interfaces, identifying
electrolytes with larger windows while retaining a Li(+) conductivity
$\sigma$(Li) > 10(-3) S cm(-1), synthesizing electrode morphologies
that reduce the size of the active particles while pinning them on
current collectors of large surface area accessible by the electrolyte,
lowering the cost of cell fabrication, designing displacement-reaction
anodes of higher capacity that allow a safe, fast charge, and designing
alternative cathode hosts. However, new strategies are needed for
batteries that go beyond powering hand-held devices, such as using
electrode hosts with two-electron redox centers; replacing the cathode
hosts by materials that undergo displacement reactions (e.g. sulfur)
by liquid cathodes that may contain flow-through redox molecules,
or by catalysts for air cathodes; and developing a Li(+) solid electrolyte
separator membrane that allows an organic and aqueous liquid electrolyte
on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Opportunities exist
for the chemist to bring together oxide and polymer or graphene chemistry
in imaginative morphologies.},

abstract = {The unique properties of ionic liquids such as a relatively wide electrochemical stability window and very low vapor pressure have made them promising candidates as electrolytes for improving the cyclic performance of lithium-air batteries. The local current density{\{},{\}} which is an important parameter in determining the performance of lithium-air batteries{\{},{\}} is a function of the rate constant of the electron transfer reactions at the surface of the cathode. In this study{\{},{\}} a novel method based on Marcus theory is presented to investigate the effect of varying the length of the alkyl side chain of model imidazolium based cations and the operating temperature on the rates of electron transfer reactions at the cathode. The necessary free energies of all the species involved in the multi-step reduction of oxygen into the peroxide ion were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). Our results indicate that the magnitude of the Gibbs free energy for the reduction of oxygen into the superoxide ion and also for the reduction of superoxide into the peroxide ion increases with an increase in the static dielectric constant of the ionic liquid. This trend in turn corresponds to the decrease in the length of the alkyl side chain of the ionic liquid cation. Furthermore{\{},{\}} the change in Gibbs free energy decreases with increase in the operating temperature. The inner-sphere reorganization energies were evaluated using Nelsen{\{}'{\}}s four point method. The total reorganization energies of all reduction reactions increase with decrease in the length of the alkyl side chain and increase in the operating temperature. Finally{\{},{\}} the rate constants of the electron transfer reaction involved in the reduction of oxygen were calculated. The logarithm of the reaction rate constants decreases with increase in the static dielectric constant and increases with increase in the operating temperature. Our results provide fundamental insight into the kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transfer reactions at the cathode that will help in the identification of appropriate electrolytes for enhanced performance of lithium-air batteries.},

The current density distribution in the cathode exhibits a sharp maximum at the 3PB and a major fraction of the total current flows in narrow zones with a width of a few percent of the electrode particle size (e.g. in the case of 1.6 ??m particle size: approximately 2/3 of the current flows in a zone with a width of 60nm). Hence, the corresponding polarisation resistance is almost inversely proportional to the 3PB length. In a wide parameter range an increasing ionic conductivity of the mixed conductor does not broaden the electrochemically active region. A formula is presented which allows an estimate of the polarisation resistance of a mixed conducting electrode if ionic transport through the electrode bulk is rate limiting. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Laino2012,
abstract = {The electrolyte role in non-aqueous lithium/air batteries is attracting
a lot of attention in several research groups, because of its fundamental
importance in producing the appropriate reversible electrochemical
reduction. While recent published works identify the lithium superoxide
as the main degrading agent for propylene carbonate (PC), there is
no clear experimental evidence that the oxygen at the cathode interface
layer does not reduce further to peroxide before reacting with PC.
Here, we investigate the reactivity of lithium peroxide versus propylene
carbonate and find that Li(2)O(2) irreversibly decomposes the carbonate
solvent, leading to alkyl carbonates. We also show that, compared
with a single Li(2)O(2) unit in PC, a crystalline surface of Li(2)O(2)
exhibits an enhanced reactivity. Our findings support the possibility
that in lithium/air cells, oxygen may still be reduced to peroxide,
with the formation of solid Li(2)O(2), which degrades by decomposing
PC.},

@article{Radin2015a,
abstract = {The performance of Li/O2 batteries is thought to be limited by charge transport through the solid Li2O2 discharge product. Prior studies suggest that electron tunneling is the main transport mechanism through thin, compact Li2O2 deposits. The present study employs a new continuum transport model to explore an alternative scenario, in which charge transport is mediated by polaron hopping. Unlike earlier models, which assume a uniform carrier concentration or local electroneutrality, the possibility of nonuniform space charge is accounted for at the Li2O2/electrolyte and Li2O2/electrode interfaces, providing a more realistic picture of transport in Li2O2 films. The temperature and current-density dependences of the discharge curves predicted by the model are in good agreement with flat-electrode experiments over a wide range of rates, supporting the hypothesis that polaron hopping contributes significantly to charge transport. Exercising the model suggests that this mechanism could explain the observed enhancement in cell performance at elevated temperature and that performance could be further improved by tuning the interfacial orientation of Li2O2 crystallites.},

abstract = {Several important ambiguities in immittance spectroscopy (IS) model data-fitting results are identified and illustrated by means of complex-nonlinear-least-squares (CNLS) fits of experimental and synthetic frequency response data. A well-known intrinsic ambiguity, following from Maxwell's electromagnetic equations, arises from the indistinguishability in external measurements of conduction and displacement currents. Usual fit models for either dielectric or conductive-system situations, such as the Davidson-Cole one, only involve a strength parameter, a dielectric constant, a characteristic relaxation time, and a fractional exponent and lead to no additional ambiguities. But the situation is different for more powerful and useful general models, such as ordinary or anomalous diffusion Poisson-Nernst-Planck ones: PNP and PNPA, used here, whose historical background, current status, and applicability are described and discussed herein. They apply to two different kinds of experimental IS situations and involve several additional, potentially free fit parameters, such as the mobilities of positive and negative charge carriers, and generation-recombination parameters that determine the partial or complete dissociation of a neutral entity of concentration N(0) into positive and negative charge carriers of equal concentration, c(0). Then, several additional ambiguities appear that may require information about the material system involved for their adequate resolution.},

abstract = {The acetylene reduction assay is a common method for assessing nitrogen fixation in a variety of marine and freshwater systems. The method measures ethylene, the product of the conversion of the gas acetylene to its reduced form by nitrogenase. Knowledge of the solubility of ethylene in aqueous solution is crucial to the cal- culation of nitrogen fixation rates and depends on the temperature and salinity of the assay conditions. Despite the increasing interest in marine nitrogen fixation, no gas solubility (Bunsen) coefficients for ethylene in seawater are published to date. Here, we provide a set of equations and present semiempirically derived Bunsen coefficients for ethylene in water (ranging from 0.069 to 0.226) for a range of temperatures and salinities that are relevant for aquatic nitrogen fixation. We apply these data to nitrogen fixation scenarios at different temperatures and salin- ities and stress the importance of using accurate Bunsen coefficients in nitrogen fixation assays.},

@article{Tan2015,
abstract = {Abstract During the discharge process of non-aqueous lithium-air batteries,
a solid product, Li2O2, forms in the pores of the porous cathode,
and eventually causes the discharge process to cease. During the
charge process, solid Li2O2 needs to be electrochemically oxidized.
The morphology of the discharge product is, therefore, critically
related to the capacity and reversibility of the battery. In this
work, we experimentally show that for a given design of the cathode,
the shape of the discharge product Li2O2 at a given discharge current
density remains almost unchanged with a change in the operating temperature,
but the size decreases with an increase in the temperature. We also
demonstrate that the product shape varies with the discharge current
density at a given temperature. The practical implication of these
findings is that the capacity, charge voltage, and cyclability of
a given non-aqueous lithium-air battery are affected by the operating
temperature.},

@article{Kant2008,
abstract = {We developed a theory for the anomalous admittance and the constant phase angle behavior of an irregular interface operating under diffusion controlled charge-transfer condition. Interfacial irregularity is modeled as a realistic random fractal, which is characterized as statistically isotropic self-affine fractals on limited length scales. The power spectrum of such a surface fractal is approximated in terms of a power law function for the intermediate wave numbers. This power spectrum has four fractal morphological parameters. They are fractal dimension (DH), lower (l) and upper (L) cutoff length scales of fractality, and the proportionality factor (mu) related to topothesy or strength of roughness. Theoretical result obtained for the admittance on such realistic fractal electrode is an indispensable step in the quantitative description of role of roughness and is applicable for all frequency regimes. This result can also be simplified to three limiting laws for the admittance or impedance. The anomalous admittance/impedance and an approximately constant phase angle behavior is explained through a limiting law for the intermediate frequencies. The intermediate frequency limiting law is dependent on the fractal dimension as well as on the lower cutoff length and strength of roughness. Finally, these results also offer an explanation for difficulties in classical power-law form for the diffusive impedance with incomplete characterization of exponent with fractal morphological parameters.},

abstract = {In this study, a new organic lithium oxygen (Li–O2) battery structure is proposed to enhance battery capacity. The electrolyte is forced to recirculate through the cathode and then saturated with oxygen in a tank external to the battery. The forced convection enhances oxygen transport and alleviates the problem of electrode blockage during discharge. A two dimensional, transient, non-isothermal simulation model is developed to study the heat and mass transfer within the battery and validate the proposed design. Results show that this novel active cathode design improves the battery capacity at all discharge current densities. The capacity of the Li–O2 battery is increased by 15.5 times (from 12.2 mAh g−1 to 201 mAh g−1) at the discharge current of 2.0 mA cm−2 when a conventional passive electrode is replaced by the newly designed active electrode. Furthermore, a cathode with non-uniform porosity is suggested and simulation results show that it can reach a higher discharge capacity without decreasing its power density. Detailed mass transport processes in the battery are also studied.},

The cathode utilizes atomic layer deposition of palladium nanoparticles on a carbon surface with an alumina coating for passivation of carbon defect sites. The low charge potential is enabled by the combination of palladium nanoparticles attached to the carbon cathode surface, a nanocrystalline form of lithium peroxide with grain boundaries, and the alumina coating preventing electrolyte decomposition on carbon. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy provides evidence for the nanocrystalline form of lithium peroxide. The new cathode material architecture provides the basis for future development of lithium-oxygen cathode materials that can be used to improve the efficiency and to extend cycle life.},

abstract = {The Li-S battery has been under intense scrutiny for over two decades,
as it offers the possibility of high gravimetric capacities and theoretical
energy densities ranging up to a factor of five beyond conventional
Li-ion systems. Herein, we report the feasibility to approach such
capacities by creating highly ordered interwoven composites. The
conductive mesoporous carbon framework precisely constrains sulphur
nanofiller growth within its channels and generates essential electrical
contact to the insulating sulphur. The structure provides access
to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulphur, and we speculate
that the kinetic inhibition to diffusion within the framework and
the sorption properties of the carbon aid in trapping the polysulphides
formed during redox. Polymer modification of the carbon surface further
provides a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of these large
anions out of the electrode, thus facilitating more complete reaction.
Reversible capacities up to 1,320 mA h g(-1) are attained. The assembly
process is simple and broadly applicable, conceptually providing
new opportunities for materials scientists for tailored design that
can be extended to many different electrode materials.},

abstract = {Stability of the electrolyte toward reduced oxygen species generated
at the cathode is a crucial challenge for the rechargeable nonaqueous
Li-O(2) battery. Here, we investigate dimethylformamide as the basis
of an electrolyte. Although reactions at the O(2) cathode on the
first discharge-charge cycle are dominated by reversible Li(2)O(2)
formation/decomposition, there is also electrolyte decomposition,
which increases on cycling. The products of decomposition at the
cathode on discharge are Li(2)O(2), Li(2)CO(3), HCO(2)Li, CH(3)CO(2)Li,
NO, H(2)O, and CO(2). Li(2)CO(3) accumulates in the electrode with
cycling. The stability of dimethylformamide toward reduced oxygen
species is insufficient for its use in the rechargeable nonaqueous
Li-O(2) battery.},

abstract = {Li/O2 batteries draw much of attention due to its outstanding theoretical specific energy, but the value of practically achievable specific energy is still under the question. In this paper we employ numerical model of Li/O2 cell, which takes into account mass transport processes, to simulate non-uniform product precipitation at different discharge current densities in acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide and 1,2-dimethoxyethane-based electrolytes. Even for 1,2-dimethoxyethane, which has the highest oxygen mobility and solubility, oxygen transport restrictions at 1 mA/cm2 lead to cell-level specific energy of about 650 Wh/kg if a pure oxygen is supplied to the cell. Finally, in order to assist the ongoing search for new cathode materials, which can be alternative to carbon, we also investigate the effect of electrode material density on cell-level specific energy and show that materials with densities up to 10 g/cm3 can be used without serious penalty to the specific energy.},

abstract = {The effects of pH on the surface reconstruction of Au(100), on CO oxidation, and on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been studied by a combination of surface X-ray scattering (SXS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements. In harmony with previous SXS and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results, the potential-induced hexagonal (?hex?) to (1 ? 1) transition occurs faster in an alkaline electrolyte than in acidic media. In alkaline solution, CO adsorption facilitates the formation of a ?hex? phase; in acid solution, however, CO has negligible effect on the potential range of thermodynamic stability of the ?hex? ? (1 ? 1) transition. We propose that in KOH the continuous removal of OHad in the Langmuir?Hinshelwood reaction (CO + OH = CO2 + H+ + e-) may stabilize the ?hex? phase over a much wider potential range than in CO-free solution. In acid solution, where specifically adsorbing anions cannot be displaced by CO from the Au(100) surface, CO has negligible effect on the equilibrium potential for the ?hex? ? (1 ? 1) transition. Such a mechanism is in agreement with the pH-dependent oxidation of CO. The ORR is also affected by the pH of solution. It is proposed that the pH-dependent kinetics of the ORR on Au(100) can be unraveled by finding the relationship between kinetic rates and two terms:? (i) the energetic term of the Au(100)?O2- interaction determines the potential regions where the rate-determining step O2 + e = O2- occurs, and (ii) the preexponential term determines the availability of active sites for the adsorption of O2-.

@article{Hu2013a,
abstract = {Metal fluorides/oxides (MF(x)/M(x)O(y)) are promising electrodes for lithium-ion batteries that operate through conversion reactions. These reactions are associated with much higher energy densities than intercalation reactions. The fluorides/oxides also exhibit additional reversible capacity beyond their theoretical capacity through mechanisms that are still poorly understood, in part owing to the difficulty in characterizing structure at the nanoscale, particularly at buried interfaces. This study employs high-resolution multinuclear/multidimensional solid-state NMR techniques, with in situ synchrotron-based techniques, to study the prototype conversion material RuO2. The experiments, together with theoretical calculations, show that a major contribution to the extra capacity in this system is due to the generation of LiOH and its subsequent reversible reaction with Li to form Li2O and LiH. The research demonstrates a protocol for studying the structure and spatial proximities of nanostructures formed in this system, including the amorphous solid electrolyte interphase that grows on battery electrodes.},

abstract = {The effects of lithium salts on the performance of Li-O<inf>2</inf>
batteries and the stability of salt anions in the O<inf>2</inf> atmosphere
during discharge/charge processes were systematically investigated
by studying seven common lithium salts in tetraglyme as electrolytes
for Li-O<inf>2</inf> batteries. The discharge products of Li-O<inf>2</inf>
reactions were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The performance
of Li-O<inf>2</inf> batteries was strongly affected by the salt used
in the electrolyte. Lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF<inf>4</inf>)
and lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) decomposed and formed LiF
and lithium oxalate, respectively, as well as lithium borates during
discharge of Li-O<inf>2</inf> batteries. In the case of other salts,
including lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), lithium
trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf), lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF
<inf>6</inf>), lithium perchlorate (LiClO<inf>4</inf>), and lithium
bromide (LiBr), the discharge products mainly consisted of Li<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>
and carbonates with minor signs of decomposition of LiTFSI, LiTf,
and LiPF <inf>6</inf>. LiBr and LiClO<inf>4</inf> showed the best
stability during the discharge process. For the cycling performance,
LiTf and LiTFSI were the best among the studied salts. In addition
to the instability of lithium salts, decomposition of tetraglyme
solvent was a more significant factor contributing to the limited
cycling stability. Thus, a more stable nonaqueous electrolyte including
organic solvent and lithium salt still needs to be further developed
to reach a fully reversible Li-O<inf>2</inf> battery. {\&}copy; 2013

The validity of the analytical solution is ascertained by comparison with the numerical solution obtained for a /polypropylene/lithium metal cell. The flexibility of the analytical solution is utilized to analyze various limiting conditions. An expression to estimate solid-phase diffusion coefficient of insertion species in a porous electrode influenced by the solution-phase diffusion process is also derived.},

abstract = {We describe physical-organic studies of singlet oxygen generation
and transport into an aqueous solution supported on superhydrophobic
surfaces on which silicon-phthalocyanine (Pc) particles are immobilized.
Singlet oxygen ((1)O2) was trapped by a water-soluble anthracene
compound and monitored in-situ using a UV-VIS spectrometer. By flowing
oxygen through the porous superhydrophobic surface, singlet oxygen
generated in the plastron (i.e. the gas layer beneath the liquid)
is transported into the solution within gas bubbles, thereby increasing
the liquid-gas surface area over which singlet oxygen can be trapped.
Significantly higher photooxidation rates were achieved in flowing
oxygen, as compared to when the gas in the plastron was static. Superhydrophobic
surfaces were also synthesized so that the Pc particles were located
in contact with, or isolated from, the aqueous solution to evaluate
the relative effectiveness of singlet oxygen generated in solution
and the gas phase respectively; singlet oxygen generated on particles
wetted by the solution was trapped more efficiently than singlet
oxygen generated in the plastron, even in the presence of flowing
oxygen gas. A mechanism is proposed that explains how Pc particle
wetting, plastron gas composition and flow rate as well as gas saturation
of the aqueous solution affect singlet oxygen trapping efficiency.
These stable superhydrophobic surfaces which can physically isolate
the photosensitizer particles from the solution may be of practical
importance for delivering singlet oxygen for water purification and
medical devices.},

Li(x)CoO(2), 0.5 < x < 1 (corresponding to 140 mA.h g(-1) of charge

to react directly with O(2) from the air at a porous electrode increases
the theoretical charge storage by a remarkable 5-10 times! Here we
demonstrate two essential prerequisites for the successful operation
of a rechargeable Li/O(2) battery; that the Li(2)O(2) formed on discharging
such an O(2) electrode is decomposed to Li and O(2) on charging (shown
here by in situ mass spectrometry), with or without a catalyst, and

abstract = {The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model is based on a mean-field approximation
of ion interactions and continuum descriptions of concentration and
electrostatic potential. It provides qualitative explanation and
increasingly quantitative predictions of experimental measurements
for the ion transport problems in many areas such as semiconductor
devices, nanofluidic systems, and biological systems, despite many
limitations. While the PNP model gives a good prediction of the ion
transport phenomenon for chemical, physical, and biological systems,
the number of equations to be solved and the number of diffusion
coefficient profiles to be determined for the calculation directly
depend on the number of ion species in the system, since each ion
species corresponds to one Nernst-Planck equation and one position-dependent
diffusion coefficient profile. In a complex system with multiple
ion species, the PNP can be computationally expensive and parameter
demanding, as experimental measurements of diffusion coefficient
profiles are generally quite limited for most confined regions such
as ion channels, nanostructures and nanopores. We propose an alternative
model to reduce number of Nernst-Planck equations to be solved in
complex chemical and biological systems with multiple ion species
by substituting Nernst-Planck equations with Boltzmann distributions
of ion concentrations. As such, we solve the coupled Poisson-Boltzmann
and Nernst-Planck (PBNP) equations, instead of the PNP equations.
The proposed PBNP equations are derived from a total energy functional
by using the variational principle. We design a number of computational
techniques, including the Dirichlet to Neumann mapping, the matched
interface and boundary, and relaxation based iterative procedure,
to ensure efficient solution of the proposed PBNP equations. Two
protein molecules, cytochrome c551 and Gramicidin A, are employed
to validate the proposed model under a wide range of bulk ion concentrations
and external voltages. Extensive numerical experiments show that
there is an excellent consistency between the results predicted from
the present PBNP model and those obtained from the PNP model in terms
of the electrostatic potentials, ion concentration profiles, and
current-voltage (I-V) curves. The present PBNP model is further validated
by a comparison with experimental measurements of I-V curves under
various ion bulk concentrations. Numerical experiments indicate that
the proposed PBNP model is more efficient than the original PNP model
in terms of simulation time.},

abstract = {In this work, we extend the activity volcano for oxygen reduction from the face-centered cubic (fcc) metal (111) facet to the (100) facet. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that the recent findings of constant scaling between OOH* and OH* holds on the fcc metal (100) facet, as well. Using this fact, we show the existence of a universal activity volcano to describe oxygen reduction electrocatalysis with a minimum overpotential, ?min = 0.37 ± 0.1 V. Specifically, we find that the (100) facet of Pt is found to bind oxygen intermediates too strongly and is not active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In contrast, Au(100) is predicted to be more active than Au(111) and comparable in activity to Pt alloys. Using this activity volcano, we further predict that Au alloys that bind OH more strongly could display improved ORR activity on the (100) facet. We carry out a computational search over candidate alloys and suggest that alloying Au with early transition metals could lead to materials that exhibit enhanced ORR activity. We also prescribe a simple principle in the choice of nanoparticle catalysts in which the chosen catalyst should have its dense facet on the weak binding leg of the volcano so that its more open facets and defects could also be active. In this work, we extend the activity volcano for oxygen reduction from the face-centered cubic (fcc) metal (111) facet to the (100) facet. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that the recent findings of constant scaling between OOH* and OH* holds on the fcc metal (100) facet, as well. Using this fact, we show the existence of a universal activity volcano to describe oxygen reduction electrocatalysis with a minimum overpotential, ?min = 0.37 ± 0.1 V.

abstract = {The state-of-the-art electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) calculations have not yet started from fully multi-dimensional modeling. For a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) with long flow channel, the impedance plot shows a multi-arc characteristic and some impedance arcs could merge. By using a step excitation/Fourier transform algorithm, an EIS simulation is implemented for the first time based on the full 2D PEMFC model presented in the first part of this work. All the dominant transient behaviors are able to be captured. A novel methodology called ‘configuration of system dynamics’, which is suitable for any electrochemical system, is then developed to resolve the physical meaning of the impedance spectra. In addition to the high-frequency arc due to charge transfer, the Nyquist plots contain additional medium/low-frequency arcs due to mass transfer in the diffusion layers and along the channel, as well as a low-frequency arc resulting from water transport in the membrane. In some case, the impedance spectra appear partly inductive due to water transport, which demonstrates the complexity of the water management of PEMFCs and the necessity of physics-based calculations.},

abstract = {The O2 electrode in Li-O2 cells was shown to exhibit gravimetric energy densities (considering the total weight of oxygen electrode in the discharged state) four times that of LiCoO2 with comparable gravimetric power. The discharge rate capability of Au-catalyzed Vulcan carbon and pure Vulcan carbon (VC) as the O2 electrode was studied in the range of 100 to 2000 mA gcarbon-1. The discharge voltage and capacity of the Li-O2 cells were shown to decrease with increasing rates. Unlike propylene carbonate based electrolytes, the rate capability of Li-O2 cells tested with 1,2-dimethoxyethane was found not to be limited by oxygen transport in the electrolyte. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) showed lithium peroxide as the discharge product and no evidence of Li2CO3 and LiOH was found. It is hypothesized that higher discharge voltages of cells with Au/C than VC at low rates could have originated from higher oxygen reduction activity of Au/C. At high rates, higher discharge voltages with Au/C than VC could be attributed to faster lithium transport in nonstoichiometric and defective lithium peroxide formed upon discharge, which is supported by XRD and X-ray absorption near edge structure O and Li K edge data.},

abstract = {Platinum utilization in the gas-diffusion catalyst layer and thin-film catalyst layer is investigated. The morphology of PTFE and Nafion in a simulated catalyst layer is examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that the platinum utilization of the thin-film catalyst layer containing only Pt/C and Nafion is 45.4{\%}. The low utilization is attributed to the fact that the electron conduction of many catalyst particles is impaired by some thick Nafion layers or clumps. For the gas-diffusion (E-TEK) electrode, the platinum utilization is mainly affected by the proton conduction provided by Nafion. The blocking effect of PTFE on the active sites is not serious. When the electrode is sufficiently impregnated with Nafion by an immersion method, the platinum utilization can reach 77.8{\%}. Transmission electron micrographs reveal that although some thick Nafion layers and clumps are observed in the Pt/C+Nafion layer, the distribution of Nafion in the catalyst layer is basically uniform. The melted PTFE disperses in the catalyst layer very uniformly. No large PTFE clumps or wide net-like structure is observed. The reactant gas may have to diffuse evenly in the catalyst layer.},

abstract = {A highly reliable experimental system that consistently closed the overall water balance to within 5{\%} was developed to study the role of a microporous layer (MPL), attached to carbon paper porous transport layer (PTL), on the water transport and performance of a standard 100cm2 active area PEM fuel cell. Various combinations of cells were built and tested with PTLs at the electrodes using either carbon fibre paper with a MPL (SGL 10BB) or carbon fibre paper without a MPL (SGL 10BA). The net water drag coefficient at three current densities (0.3, 0.5 and 0.7Acm−2) for two combinations of anode/cathode relative humidity (60/100{\%} and 100/60{\%}) and stoichiometric ratios of H2/air (1.4/3 and 1.4/2) was determined from water balance measurements. The addition of a MPL to the carbon fibre paper PTL at the cathode did not cause a statistically significant change to the overall drag coefficient although there was a significant improvement to the fuel cell performance and durability when a MPL was used at the cathode. The presence of a MPL on either electrode or on both electrodes also exhibited similar performance compared to when the MPL was placed at the cathode. These results indicate that the presence of MPL indeed improves the cell performance although it does not affect the net water drag coefficient. The correlation between cell performance and global water transport cannot be ascertained and warrants further experimental investigation.},

abstract = {Accuracy in the effective diffusion coefficient of the gas diffusion layer (GDL)/microporous layer (MPL) is important to accurately predict the mass transport limitations for high current density operation of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. All the previous studies regarding mass transport limitations were limited to pure GDLs, and experimental analysis of the impact of the MPL on the overall diffusion in the porous GDL is still lacking. A modified Loschmidt cell with an oxygen–nitrogen mixture is used in this work to determine the effect of MPL on the effective diffusion coefficients. It is found that Knudsen effects play a dominant role in the diffusion through the MPL where pore diameters are less than 1$\mu$m.

abstract = {The air electrode performance of various carbon materials, such as Ketjen black (KB), acetylene black (AB and AB-S), Vulcan XC-72R (VX), and vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) with and without La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) catalyst were examined in an aqueous solution of saturated LiOH with 10 M LiCl in the current density range 0.2–2.0 mA cm−2. The best performance for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions was observed for the KB electrode, which has the highest surface area among the carbon materials examined. A steady over-potential of 0.2 V was obtained for the oxygen reduction reaction using the KB electrode without the catalyst, while the over-potential was 0.15 V for KB with the LSCF catalyst at 2.0 mA cm−2. The over-potentials for the oxygen evolution reaction were slightly higher than those for the oxygen reduction reaction, and gradually increased with the polarization period. Analysis of the gas in the cell after polarization above 0.4 V revealed the evolution of a small amount of CO during the oxygen evolution reaction by the decomposition of carbon in the electrode. The amount of CO evolved was significantly decreased by the addition of LSCF to the carbon electrode.},

spectroscopy measurements play a multifunctional role: they enable
elucidation of the physical models of the interface, provide the
information about the effective capacitance of SAMs thus probing
the dielectric properties of the adsorbed layers, and evaluate the
ability of charged electrolyte components to approach the electrode
surface through the SAM (using adsorbing/desorbing SO4(2-) as an
electroactive probe). The latter is important to assess the extent
of defects in the formed organic layers. Finally, monitoring the
direct current during SAM formation together with the collected gravimetric
data can give additional important information about the process.
A series of n-mercaptoalcohols with different hydrocarbon chain length

Collection experiments reveal a potential and rotation rate independent collection efficiency. RRDE measurements allow, for the first time, the direct determination of the fraction of peroxide production during oxygen reduction on supported catalysts. Finally, comparison of measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M HClO4, respectively, reveals a significant effect of (bi)sulfate adsorption on the orr activity.

@misc{Garcia2007,
abstract = {Recently, batteries with interpenetrating electrode architectures have been proposed which have the potential to outperform classical designs. These electrode structures are highly percolating particle distributions with short diffusion distances. One of the main advantages with respect to classic rocking chair battery designs is the decrease of the ohmic losses and localized joule- heating, while simultaneously delivering higher power densities and specific energies closer to the theoretical ideal. In the present paper, the rocking chair lithium-ion battery architecture is taken as a point of reference to explore two variations of a three- dimensional battery concept. The first microstructure possesses a highly branched tortuous positive electrode particle distribution, and the second architecture corresponds to a topology with perfectly ordered branches of positive electrode materials. Both architectures outperform the classic rocking chair design by a factor of five for intermediate discharge rates and by 37{\%} for high discharge rates; however, branch ordering has the advantage of improving the macroscopic discharge time by 18{\%} for discharge rates of 4C or higher. Simulations show that the power density of a rechargeable battery can be engineered by maximizing the electrochemical driving force for intercalation while decreasing the characteristic transport distances of the material components. Additionally, the analyzed devices greatly diminish the possibility of salt precipitation during discharge due to removal of microstructure limitations in the classic design. Results also show that for the interpenetrating architectures, when lithium plating and fracture fatigue do occur, they initiate at the tips of the branches of anode material, particularly in those regions that are closer to the electrode phase of opposite polarity. Increasing branch tortuosity induces lithium depletion at the back ohmic contact of the positive electrode at high discharge rates.},

abstract = {Lithium iron borate (LiFeBO3) has a high theoretical specific capacity (220 mAh/g), which is competitive with leading cathode candidates for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, a major factor making it difficult to fully access this capacity is a competing oxidative process that leads to degradation of the LiFeBO3 structure. The pristine, delithiated, and degraded phases of LiFeBO3 share a common framework with a cell volume that varies by less than 2{\%}, making it difficult to resolve the nature of the delithiation and degradation mechanisms by conventional X-ray powder diffraction studies. A comprehensive study of the structural evolution of LiFeBO3 during (de)lithiation and degradation was therefore carried out using a wide array of bulk and local structural characterization techniques, both in situ and ex situ, with complementary electrochemical studies. Delithiation of LiFeBO3 starts with the production of LitFeBO3 (t ≈ 0.5) through a two-phase reaction, and the subsequent delithiation of this phase to form Lit-xFeBO3 (x < 0.5). However, the large overpotential needed to drive the initial two-phase delithiation reaction results in the simultaneous observation of further delithiated solid-solution products of Lit-xFeBO3 under normal conditions of electrochemical cycling. The degradation of LiFeBO3 also results in oxidation to produce a Li-deficient phase D-LidFeBO3 (d ≈ 0.5, based on the observed Fe valence of ∼2.5+). However, it is shown through synchrotron X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies that the degradation process results in an irreversible disordering of Fe onto the Li site, resulting in the formation of a distinct degraded phase, which cannot be electrochemically converted back to LiFeBO3 at room temperature. The Li-containing degraded phase cannot be fully delithiated, but it can reversibly cycle Li (D-Lid+yFeBO3) at a thermodynamic potential of ∼1.8 V that is substantially reduced relative to the pristine phase (∼2.8 V).},

abstract = {The ac-impedance spectroscopy of the electro-oxidation of 2-propanol
and methanol was investigated in a H2SO4 solution using a carbon-supported
platinum catalyst as a function of potential between 350 and 750
mV (vs. SHE) at a variety of temperatures between 303 and 353 K.
It is found that the impedance spectrum of 2-propanol is very similar
to that of methanol. Semicircles that have induction loops at the
low frequency ends were observed in complex plane plots at high potentials
between 600 and 750 mV in both the cases of 2-propanol and methanol,
which suggests that the rate-determining steps of the electro-oxidation
of intermediates adsorbed on platinum should be involved in their
reaction processes. Assuming appropriate models involving the adsorbed
intermediates for 2-propanol and methanol, the impedance spectra
were explained successfully. The impedance analysis provides the
values of reaction parameters concerning a coverage relaxation time
for an intermediate and a charge-transfer resistance, which make
it possible to compare the reaction rates of the intermediates between
2-propanol and methanol. The reaction parameters suggest that a consecutive
reaction involving the intermediate for 2-propanol proceeds more
slowly than that for methanol, and also suggest that a direct reaction
pathway from 2-propanol to acetone, which does not go through the
intermediate, exists in parallel. Additionally, the influences of
acetone concentration on the coverage relaxation time and the charge-transfer
resistance for the electro-oxidation of 2-propanol were also discussed.

abstract = {The non-aqueous Li-air (O2) battery is receiving intense interest
because its theoretical specific energy exceeds that of Li-ion batteries.
Recharging the Li-O2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide
(Li2O2), which is formed on discharge within the porous cathode.
However, transporting charge between Li2O2 particles and the solid
electrode surface is at best very difficult and leads to voltage
polarization on charging, even at modest rates. This is a significant
problem facing the non-aqueous Li-O2 battery. Here we show that incorporation
of a redox mediator, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), enables recharging
at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator.
On charging, TTF is oxidized to TTF(+) at the cathode surface; TTF(+)
in turn oxidizes the solid Li2O2, which results in the regeneration
of TTF. The mediator acts as an electron-hole transfer agent that
permits efficient oxidation of solid Li2O2. The cell with the mediator
demonstrated 100 charge/discharge cycles.},

abstract = {Non-aqueous Li-air-batteries can provide potentially a very high energy density. The reaction at the positive electrode is the oxygen reduction reaction. Its products are lithium oxides (mainly Li2O2) that deposit as solid compound in the porous gas diffusion electrode (GDE). This can cause passivation of the electrode surface or clogging of gas diffusion pathway though the porous material. Here a new method is reported to measure in-situ the oxygen permeation though a GDE during the discharge process. It is based on the concepts of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in which a positionable microelectrode (ME) is used to detect the influx of oxygen in an deaerated electrolyte close to the outer surface of the GDE. However, no steady-state current for oxygen reduction at the ME can be obtained in Li-containing electrolytes because solid lithium oxides also deposit on the ME. Therefore, a pulsed potential program was developed that periodically removes deposits from the surface of the ME and eliminates the effect of surface passivation of the probe electrode. We validated this method by monitoring the oxygen reduction current at the ME as a result of oxygen permeating GDEs of different thickness.},

this serves as a good measure of electrolyte and binder stability.
Superoxide readily dehydrofluorinates polyvinylidene to give byproducts

Oxygen diffusion coefficients were calculated from electrolyte viscosities using the Stokes-Einstein relation. Oxygen solubility, electrolyte viscosity, and oxygen partial pressure were all directly correlated to discharge capacity and rate capability. Substantial improvement in cell performance was achieved through electrolyte optimization and increased oxygen partial pressure. The concentration of oxygen in the electrode under discharge was calculated using a semi-infinite medium model with simultaneous diffusion and reaction. The model was used to explain the dependence of cell performance on oxygen transport in organic electrolyte.},

@article{Ashcraft2008,
abstract = {This work reports computed rate coefficients of 90 reactions important
in the autocatalytic oxidation of hydroxylamine in aqueous nitric
acid. Rate coefficients were calculated using four approaches: Smoluchowski
(Stokes-Einstein) diffusion, a solution-phase incarnation of transition
state theory based on quantum chemistry calculations, simple Marcus
theory for electron-transfer reactions, and a variational TST approach
for dissociative isomerization reactions that occur in the solvent
cage. Available experimental data were used to test the accuracy
of the computations. There were significant discrepancies between
the computed and experimental values for some key parameters, indicating
a need for improvements in computational methodology. Nonetheless,
the 90-reaction mechanism showed the ability to reproduce many of
the trends seen in experimental studies of this very complicated
kinetic system. This work highlights reactions that may govern the
system evolution and branching behavior critical to the stability
of the system. We hope that this analysis will guide experimental
investigations to reduce the uncertainties in the critical rate coefficients
and thermochemistry, allowing an unambiguous determination of the
dominant reaction pathways in the system. Advances in efficient and
accurate solvation models that effectively separate entropic and
enthalpic contributions will most directly benefit solution-phase
modeling efforts. Methods for more accurately estimating activity
coefficients, including at infinite dilution in multicomponent mixtures,
are needed for modeling high ionic strength aqueous systems. A detailed
derivation of the solution-phase equilibrium and transition state
theory rate expressions in solution is included in the Supporting

abstract = {Electrical energy storage for transportation has gone beyond the limit
of converntional lithium ion batteries currently. New material or
new battery system development is an alternative approach to achieve
the goal of new high-energy storage system with energy densities
5 times or more greater. A series of SeSx-carbon (x = 0-7) composite
materials has been prepared and evaluated as the positive electrodes
in secondary lithium cells with ether-based electrolyte. In situ
synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction was utilized to investigate
the crystalline phase transition during cell cycling. Complementary,
in situ Se K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis was
used to track the evolution of the Se valence state for both crystalline
and noncrystalline phases, including amorphous and electrolyte-dissolved
phases in the (de)lithiation process. On the basis of these results,
a mechanism for the (de)lithiation process is proposed, where Se
is reduced to the polyselenides, Li2Sen (n {\^{a}}‰¥ 4), Li2Se2, and Li2Se
sequentially during the lithiation and Li2Se is oxidized to Se through
Li2Sen (n {\^{a}}‰¥ 4) during the delithiation. In addition, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated
the reversibility of the Li/Se system in ether-based electrolyte
and the presence of side products in the carbonate-based electrolytes.
For Li/SeS2 and Li/SeS7 cells, Li2Se and Li2S are the discharged
products with the presence of Se only as the crystalline phase in
the end of charge.},

The cathode utilizes atomic layer deposition of palladium nanoparticles on a carbon surface with an alumina coating for passivation of carbon defect sites. The low charge potential is enabled by the combination of palladium nanoparticles attached to the carbon cathode surface, a nanocrystalline form of lithium peroxide with grain boundaries, and the alumina coating preventing electrolyte decomposition on carbon. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy provides evidence for the nanocrystalline form of lithium peroxide.

abstract = {We investigate the permeability and selectivity of graphene sheets
with designed subnanometer pores using first principles density functional
theory calculations. We find high selectivity on the order of 10(8)
for H(2)/CH(4) with a high H(2) permeance for a nitrogen-functionalized
pore. We find extremely high selectivity on the order of 10(23) for
H(2)/CH(4) for an all-hydrogen passivated pore whose small width
(at 2.5 A) presents a formidable barrier (1.6 eV) for CH(4) but easily
surmountable for H(2) (0.22 eV). These results suggest that these
pores are far superior to traditional polymer and silica membranes,
where bulk solubility and diffusivity dominate the transport of gas
molecules through the material. Recent experimental investigations,
using either electron beams or bottom-up synthesis to create pores
in graphene, suggest that it may be possible to employ such techniques
to engineer variable-sized, graphene nanopores to tune selectivity
and molecular diffusivity. Hence, we propose using porous graphene
sheets as one-atom-thin, highly efficient, and highly selective membranes
for gas separation. Such a pore could have widespread impact on numerous
energy and technological applications; including carbon sequestration,
fuel cells, and gas sensors.},

abstract = {A model for anode performance of a planar anode-supported SOFC is developed. The model includes Butler–Volmer relation for the hydrogen oxidation, Ohm’s law for ionic current and equation of hydrogen mass balance in the anode channel. We show that the regime of anode operation depends on the relation between the cell current density j and the critical current density jcrit. Analytical solutions to the system of governing equations for the case of “low” (j<jcrit) and “high” (j≫jcrit) currents are derived. In the “low-current” regime the anode polarization voltage is proportional to cell current, which justifies the notion of anodic activation resistivity Ra. Full hydrogen utilization increases the value of Ra by a factor of 2. In the “high-current” regime polarization voltage depends on cell current logarithmically, with the effective Tafel slope being twice the kinetic value (doubling of Tafel slope). In this regime 100{\%} hydrogen utilization leads to a constant ≃230-mV shift of polarization curve as a whole.},

abstract = {The discharge mechanism of a Li–O2 battery involves lithium superoxide (LiO2) radicals. In this Letter, we have performed high-level quantum chemical calculations (G4MP2) to investigate the structure and stability of LiO2 clusters. The clusters have planar ring-shaped structures, high spins, and are thermodynamically more stable than LiO2 dimer. The computed energy barrier for disproportionation of the larger clusters is also significantly higher than the corresponding barrier in the LiO2 dimer (1.0 eV vs 0.5 eV). This means that disproportionation rate should be much slower if the reaction involves LiO2 clusters other than the dimer. As a result, the clusters may survive long enough to be incorporated into the growing discharge product. These results are discussed in terms of recent experimental studies of the electronic structure and morphology of the discharge products in Li–air batteries.},

In all the cases, the CCL impedance spectrum is an ideal or distorted semicircle linked to the straight 45°-degree line in the high-frequency domain. Spectrum distortion (elongation along the real axis) manifests the regime with doubling of apparent Tafel slope, resulting from the proton- or oxygen-transport limitations in the system. In the case of ideal oxygen transport, the spectra corresponding to different currents do not intersect, while the oxygen transport loss manifests itself as an intersection of spectra. This feature provide a simple means for understanding the regime of CCL operation.},

abstract = {To explain why dynamical properties of an aqueous electrolyte near
a charged surface seem to be governed by a surface charge less than
the actual one, the canonical Stern model supposes an interfacial
layer of ions and immobile fluid. However, large ion mobilities within
the Stern layer are needed to reconcile the Stern model with surface
conduction measurements. Modeling the aqueous electrolyte-amorphous
silica interface at typical charge densities, a prototypical double
layer system, the flow velocity does not vanish until right at the
surface. The Stern model is a good effective model away from the
surface, but cannot be taken literally near the surface. Indeed,
simulations show no ion mobility where water is immobile, nor is
such mobility necessary since the surface conductivity in the simulations
is comparable to experimental values.},

The results show that, in NaOH and KOH solutions, the ORR, a quasi-reversible diffusion-controlled reaction, is largely dependent on the electrolyte conditions, and KOH solutions are superior to NaOH solutions for the ORR process in both thermodynamic and kinetic consideration. As the alkaline concentration increases, the ORR performance frustrates, and the protonation of superoxide is suppressed; thus, the ORR shifts from a 2e reduction pathway to a 1e reduction pathway in both solutions.},

abstract = {This paper shows and discusses the results obtained after an experimental session devoted to characterization of the behavior of a single proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) with variation of the values of six operation variables: cell temperature; anode flow temperature in saturation and dry conditions; cathode flow temperature in saturation and dry conditions; and reactants pressure. The fuel cell employed for the experiments is a single PEMFC with a 25cm2 Nafion® 115 membrane. As expected, a higher cell temperature increases the membrane conductivity and the exchange current density with an improvement of the cell behaviour. An increase in the reactant saturation temperature also leads to a better performance, especially in the case of low and medium loads. Conversely, in the case of a low cell temperature, it is better to reduce the water inlet mass flow at high loads to avoid electrode flooding. With an increase of the reactant operating pressure, the maximum of the power curve shifts to higher current densities, and this could be linked to the corresponding shift of the limiting current density. A combined effect of humidification and operating pressure was observed: the increase of operating pressure did not offer a significant improvement when the reactants were dry, while leading to improvements when a partial humidification (only at the anode) was adopted. The best improvements due to a pressure increase were observed when both anode and cathode are humidified. Finally, some tests of other authors at the same operation conditions have been considered, and a comparison has been done.},

A simple method for checking the quality of the local current density distribution by comparison of two polarization curves measured at different oxygen stoichiometries is suggested. Aging processes running non–uniformly along the channel distort the optimal shape of the local current and affect the cell polarization curve. Non–uniform aging of the cathode catalyst (agglomeration) increases the activation and transport overpotentials, not changing the limiting current density. Local lowering of the GDL oxygen diffusivity decreases the cell limiting current, not affecting the activation overpotential. A combined effect of the two aforementioned processes increases the slope of the polarization curve, which may be misinterpreted as the growth of the cell ohmic resistivity. An equation for reconstruction of the local current, exchange current density and GDL oxygen diffusivity shapes from the cell polarization curve is discussed.},

Reported values of evaporation coefficient of water range from 0.1 to 1 and despite many attempts to explain this large variation the evaporation coefficient is still a subject of dispute. Three explanations which have often been used to account for low evaporation coefficients are: molecular structure, molecular collision in the vapour phase and heat transfer limitations in the liquid phase. Following an extensive discussion, it is concluded that molecular collision and heat transfer limitations can have a considerable influence on experimental evaporation rates and thus apparent evaporation coefficients. However, it now seems unlikely that molecular structure has a major effect on this coefficient. We conclude from this investigation that for pure water evaporating into a space containing only water vapour, the true evaporation coefficient is unity under all conditions of pressure and temperature.},

@article{Bergner2014,
abstract = {Non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries are an intensively studied future energy
storage technology due to their high theoretical energy density.
However, a number of barriers prevent a practical application, and
one of the major challenges is the reduction of the high charge overpotential:
Whereas lithium peroxide (Li2O2) is formed during discharge at around
2.7 V (vs. Li+/Li), its electrochemical decomposition during the
charge process requires potentials up to 4.5 V. This high potential
gap leads to a low round-trip efficiency of the cell, and more important,
the high charge potential causes electrochemical decomposition of
other cell constituents. Dissolved oxidation catalysts can act as
mobile redox mediators (RM) which enable the oxidation of Li2O2 particles
even without a direct electric contact to the positive electrode.
Herein we show that the addition of 10 mM TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl),
homogeneously dissolved in the electrolyte, provides a distinct reduction
of the charging potentials by 500 mV. Moreover, TEMPO enables a significant
enhancement of the cycling stability leading to a doubling of the
cycle life. The efficiency of the TEMPO mediated catalysis was further
investigated by a parallel monitoring of the cell pressure which
excludes a considerable contribution of a parasitic shuttle (i.e.
internal ionic short circuit) to the anode during cycling. We prove
the suitability of TEMPO by a systematic study of the relevant physical
and chemical properties, i.e. its (electro )chemical stability, redox
potential, diffusion coefficient and the influence on the oxygen
solubility. Furthermore the charging mechanism of Li-O2 cells with
and without TEMPO were compared by combining different electrochemical
and analytical techniques.},

abstract = {Non-aqueous electrolytes play a prominent role in the redox reactions of the oxygen electrode in the non-aqueous Li-air battery. In all electrolytes the initial O2 reduction reaction (ORR) product is superoxide, O2−, whose stability is determined by the Lewis acidity of the ion-pairing cations present in the medium as governed by the Hard Soft Acid Base (HSAB) theory. Our results suggest that depending on the basicity of the solvent as measured by its Donor Number (DN), the superoxide will be stabilized to varying lengths of time before transforming to O22− via a chemical or an electrochemical reaction. Organic solvents decrease the Lewis acidity of Li+ through the formation of solvates, Li+(solvent)n. As a result, high DN solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which decrease Li+ acidity more than low DN solvents, provide longer life-time for the soft base O2− by forming the ion pair, Li+(DMSO)n–O2−. In low DN solvents such as 1, 2-dimethoxy ethane (DME) and tetraethyleneglycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), the LiO2 rapidly decomposes to the peroxide, Li2O2. As the ionic bond strength between the O2 reduction product and the conducting salt cation becomes stronger, its rechargeability becomes poorer. Solvent electron donor property affects ORR catalysis also.},

abstract = {A simple Fourier transform (FT) method is presented for obtaining a Distribution Function of Relaxation Times (DFRT) for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. By using a special data extension procedure the FT is performed over the range from -∞≤ln$\omega$≤+∞. The integration procedure is analytic in the end regions, otherwise a quadratic interpolation is used. For the necessary windowing of the first FT result, a special Tanh window function is used, which shows better results than the well-known Hann window function. An alternative approach, based on a complex nonlinear least squares (CNLS) fit of a linear sequence of (RQ)’s, provides the DFRT directly, but often significantly deviating from the FT-DFRT. With several examples the usefulness of a DFRT in impedance analysis is tested. The main conclusion is that the visibility in the DFRT of separate dispersive contributions strongly depends on the associated resistance and the width of the distribution. ‘Near equal strength’ dispersive contributions show up in the DFRT, where the area under the DFRT-peak represents the ‘strength’ or resistance. But small peaks with a large FWHM are lost, although these can easily be identified in a CNLS-fit. A comparison between the finite length Warburg (FLW) and the almost identical Gerischer impedance shows a clear difference in the DFRT. Indications are found that the characteristic Gerischer DFRT might be distinguishable in real measurement DFRT's. In cooperation with an external group a brief test with an adaptive genetic evolution method showed promising results for a direct definition of a DFRT. In this process the reconstructed impedance is matched to the actual measurement.},

nm), we postulate that the attraction results from fluctuating bare
Coulomb interactions between individual ions and the metallic pore
surfaces (image forces) that are not captured by meanfield theories,
such as the Poisson-Boltzmann-Stern model or its mathematical limit
for overlapping double layers, the Donnan model. Using reasonable
estimates of the micropore permittivity and mean size (and no other
fitting parameters), we propose a simple theory that predicts the
attractive chemical potential inferred from experiments. As additional
evidence for attractive forces, we present data for salt adsorption
in uncharged microporous carbons, also predicted by the theory.},

@book{Weber2004,
abstract = {In this review, we have examined the different models for polymer-electrolyte
fuel cells operating with hydrogen. The major focus has been on transport
of the various species within the fuel cell. The different regions
of the fuel cell were examined, and their modeling methodologies
and equations were elucidated. In particular, the 1-D fuel-cell sandwich
was discussed thoroughly because it is the most important part of
the fuel-cell assembly. Models that included other effects such as
temperature gradients and transport in other directions besides through
the fuel-cell sandwich were also discussed. Models were not directly
compared to each other; instead they were broken down into their
constitutive parts. The reason for this is that validation of the
models is usually accomplished by comparison of simulation to experimental
polarization data (e.g., Figure 3). However, other data can also
be used such as the net flux of water through the membrane. In fitting
these data, the models vary not only in their complexity and treatments
but also in their number and kind of fitting parameters. This is
one reason it is hard to justify one approach over another by just
looking at the modeling results. In general, it seems reasonable
that the more complex models, which are based on physical arguments
and do not contain many fitting parameters, are perhaps closest to
reality. Of course, this assumes that they fit the experimental data
and observations. This last point has been overlooked in the validation
of many models. For example, a model may fit the data very well for
certain operating conditions, but if it does not at least predict
the correct trend when one of those conditions is changed, then the
model is shown to be valid only within a certain operating range.
This review has highlighted the important effects that should be
modeled. These include two-phase flow of liquid water and gas in
the fuel-cell sandwich, a robust membrane model that accounts for
the different membrane transport modes, nonisothermal effects, especially
in the directions perpendicular to the sandwich, and multidimensional
effects such as changing gas composition along the channel, among
others. For any model, a balance must be struck between the complexity
required to describe the physical reality and the additional costs
of such complexity. In other words, while more complex models more
accurately describe the physics of the transport processes, they
are more computationally costly and may have so many unknown parameters
that their results are not as meaningful. Hopefully, this review
has shown and broken down for the reader the vast complexities of
transport within polymer-electrolyte fuel cells and the various ways
they have been and can be modeled.},

a possible alternative to current state-of-the-art rechargeable Li-ion

the maximum discharge capacity in nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries is limited
to a small fraction of its theoretical value due to the insulating
nature of lithium peroxide (Li2O2), the battery{\{}'{\}}s primary discharge
product. In this work, we show that the inclusion of trace amounts
of electrolyte additives, such as H2O, significantly improve the
capacity of the Li-O2 battery. These additives trigger a solution-based
growth mechanism due to their solvating properties, thereby circumventing
the Li2O2 conductivity limitation. Experimental observations and
a growth model imply that this solution mechanism is responsible
for Li2O2 toroid formation. We present a general formalism describing
an additive{\{}'{\}}s tendency to trigger the solution process, providing
a rational design route for electrolytes that afford larger Li-air

abstract = {This article investigates the effects of discrete dopant location and concentration on the differential capacitance of nanoscale metallic probes situated on the surface of semiconductor materials. Using the formalism of doping sensitivity functions, it is shown that the differential capacitance of such systems is particularly sensitive to the exact location and concentration of dopant atoms, which can potentially lead to the development of new techniques for atomistic 3-D dopant profiling. Such techniques require solving the inverse problem, in which we compute the 3-D dopant profile from the output capacitance-voltage characteristics of the system. This problem is mathematically challenging, but can be solved in principle using the formalism of doping sensitivity functions. In the final part of the presentation we present a number of sample simulations and analyze the challenges of this approach.},

While the weak binding of OOH* on Au(111) makes it an unsuitable catalyst for the 4e? reduction, this weak binding is optimal for the 2e? reduction to H2O2.

abstract = {In this chapter, to facilitate understanding and preparing the basic knowledge for rotating electrode theory, both the electron-transfer and reactant transport theories at the interface of electrode/electrolyte are presented. Regarding the reactant transport, three transportation modes such as diffusion, migration, and convection are described. A focusing discussion is given to the reactant diffusion near the electrode surface using both Fick's first and second laws. In addition, based on the approach in literature, the kinetics of reactant transport near and within a porous matrix electrode layer and its effect on the electron-transfer process is also presented using a simple equivalent electrode/electrolyte interface.},

In this paper we present and discuss a multiphase continuum model of an aqueous lithium-oxygen single cell including reactions and transport in a porous gas diffusion electrode (GDE). The model is parameterized using in-house half-cell experiments and available literature data on aqueous electrolytes. We validate our transport model with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements over a wide range of temperatures (25, 40, 55 °C) and electrolyte concentrations (0.1-2 M). We observe very good agreement between simulations and measurements during oxygen reduction conditions. A sensitivity analysis of the validated model demonstrates the influence of the porous structure on GDE performance and gives directions for the future development of electrodes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Increasing demand for energy, energy security and the need to minimize the impact on the environment related to energy are the major drivers for the research and development of alternative energy technologies. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising alternative technology. However, their performance, in other words efficiency, can be hindered severely by the presence of contaminants. Impurities in the oxidant and fuel feeds act as barriers to the oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation. These impurities arise from the use of atmospheric air as the oxidant and hydrogen from reformate as the fuel. The electrolyte membrane can be attacked by ions originating from the cell components. These ions decrease the mechanical and chemical stability of the membrane resulting in the decrease of proton conductivity and reactant crossover. Due to the severity of these poisoning phenomena, much work has been dedicated to understanding their chemical kinetics, their effects and mitigation methods. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the experimental, analytical and numerical work devoted to understanding the contamination of the cathode, electrolyte membrane and anode. A summary of future directions and research topics is also given.},

reactions (OERs). To overcome this drawback, we take the lesson from
other catalysis researches that showed improved catalytic activities
by employing metal alloy catalysts. Such research effort has led
us to find Pt3Co nanoparticles as an effective OER catalyst in Li-O2
batteries. The superior catalytic activity was reflected in the substantially
decreased overpotentials and improved cycling/rate performance compared
to those of other catalysts. Density functional theory calculations
suggested that the low OER overpotentials are associated with the
reduced adsorption strength of LiO2 on the outermost Pt catalytic
sites. Also, the alloy catalyst generates amorphous Li2O2 conformally
coated around the catalyst and thus facilitates easier decomposition
and higher reversibility. This investigation conveys an important
message that understanding elementary reactions and surface charge
engineering of air-catalysts are one of the most effective approaches
in resolving the chronic sluggish charging kinetics in Li-O2 batteries.},

formulation of electrode–electrolyte system of an electric double

charge transport across the electrode-electrolyte system. It is based
on volume averaging, a widely used technique in multiphase flow modeling
([1,2]) and is analogous to porous media theory employed for electrochemical
systems [3–5]. A single-domain approach is considered in the formulation
where there is no need to model the interfacial boundary conditions
explicitly as done in prior literature ([6]). Spatio-temporal variations,
anisotropic physical properties, and upscaled parameters from lower
length-scale simulations and experiments can be easily introduced
in the formulation. Model complexities like irregular geometric configuration,
porous electrodes, charge transport and related performance characteristics
of the supercapacitor can be effectively captured in higher dimensions.
This generalized model also provides insight into the applicability
of 1D models ([6]) and where multidimensional effects need to be
considered. A sensitivity analysis is presented to ascertain the
dependence of the charge and discharge processes on key model parameters.
Finally, application of the formulation to non-planar supercapacitors
is presented.},

abstract = {Composites are formed by sorption of Nafion, an ion exchange polymer,
onto inert substrates of two different microstructures: microcylinders
(neutron track etched membranes) and microspheres. Flux of a neutral
redox probe (hydroquinone) through the composites is measured voltammetrically.
Data for the microsphere composites are presented for variation in
volume fraction and bead radii. Flux is shown to increase as the
ratio of surface area of the substrate to volume of Nafion increases.
The enhancement is ascribed to a facile surface diffusion domain
at the interface between the Nafion and the inert substrates. Enhancements
are larger in the microcylinder composites. Images of the microsphere
composites appear fractal. For the microsphere composites, the power
law relating flux to a characteristic dimension (microsphere radius)
has an exponent of 0.78. A similar analysis for the cylinders has
an exponent of 1. The analysis also shows that the fundamental transport
rates of surface and bulk diffusion are little different in the two
composites. Thus, the difference in the flux characteristics of the
two classes of composites is ascribed to the microstructure of the
interface as opposed to a change in the basic flux properties. (A
linear fit of the microsphere composite data is statistically comparable
that of the fractal fit; however, the conductivity exponent of one
for the linear fit does not capture the dimensionality of the microsphere/Nafion
interface.) The smallest microspheres of radius 0.055 {\{}$\mu${\}}m form
agglomerates of radius 1.25 to 1.5 {\{}$\mu${\}}m, while their flux characteristics

abstract = {Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are one of the most promising candidates for high-energy-density storage systems. However, the low utilization of porous carbon and the inefficient transport of reactants in the cathode limit terribly the practical capacity and, in particular, the rate capability of state-of-the-art Li-O2 batteries. Here, free-standing, hierarchically porous carbon (FHPC) derived from graphene oxide (GO) gel in nickel foam without any additional binder is synthesized by a facile and effective in situ sol-gel method, wherein the GO not only acts as a special carbon source, but also provides the framework of a 3D gel; more importantly, the proper acidity via its intrinsic COOH groups guarantees the formation of the whole structure. Interestingly, when employed as a cathode for Li-O2 batteries, the capacity reaches 11 060 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 (280 mA g−1); and, unexpectedly, a high capacity of 2020 mA h g−1 can be obtained even the current density increases ten times, up to 2 mA cm−2 (2.8 A g−1), which is the best rate performance for Li-O2 batteries reported to date. This excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the loose packing of the carbon, the hierarchical porous structure, and the high electronic conductivity of the Ni foam.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study on the effect of inhomogeneous compression of gas diffusion layer (GDL) caused by the channel/rib structure of flow-field plate. The experimentally evaluated properties are GDL intrusion into the channel, gas permeability, in-plane and through-plane bulk electric conductivities, and contact resistances at interfaces as a function of compressed thickness of GDL. It was found that the GDL is compressed very little under the channel whereas GDL under the rib is compressed to gasket thickness. The compression of GDL reduces gas permeability and contact resistance, and improves bulk conductivity. Hence, the inhomogeneous compression of GDL may lead into significant local variation of mass and charge transport properties in the GDL. These effects have been ignored in most of the published modeling studies. This contribution, part I, covers the experimental setup and measurement results, and a model which takes the inhomogeneous compression of GDL into account is presented in part II.},

@article{Hyder2013,
abstract = {Next-generation electrochemical energy storage for integrated microsystems and consumer electronic devices requires novel electrode materials with engineered architectures to meet the requirements of high performance, low cost, and robustness. However, conventional electrode fabrication processes such as doctor blading afford limited control over the electrode thickness and structure at the nanoscale and require the incorporation of insulating binder and other additives, which can promote agglomeration and reduce active surface area, limiting the inherent advantages attainable from nanoscale materials. We have engineered a route for the synthesis of highly stable, sub-8 nm TiO2 nanoparticles and their subsequent incorporation with acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) into nanostructured electrodes using aqueous-based layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly. Using this approach, binder-free thin film electrodes with highly controllable thicknesses up to the micrometer scale were developed with well-dispersed, nonagglomerated TiO2 nanoparticles on MWNTs. Upon testing in an Li electrochemical half-cell, these electrodes demonstrate high capacity (>150 mAh/gel(ectrode) at 0.1 A/gel(ectrode)), good rate capability (>100 mAh/gel(ectrode) up to 1 A/g(electrode)) and nearly no capacity loss up to 200 cycles for electrodes with thicknesses up to 1480 nm, indicating their promise as thin-film negative electrodes for future Li storage applications.},

abstract = {Matrix diffusion is an important transport process in geologic materials
of low hydraulic conductivity. For predicting the fate and transport
of contaminants, a detailed understanding of the diffusion processes
in natural porous media is essential. In this study, diffusive tracer
transport (iodide) was investigated in a variety of geologically
different limestone and sandstone rocks. Porosity, structural and
mineralogical composition, hydraulic conductivity, and other rock
properties were determined. The effective diffusion coefficients
were measured using the time-lag method. The results of the diffusion
experiments indicate that there is a close relationship between total
porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient of a rock (analogous
to Archie's Law). Consequently, the tortousity factor can be expressed
as a function of total porosity. The relationship fits best for thicker
samples (> 1.0 cm) with high porosities (> 20{\%}), because of the
reduced influence of heterogeneity in larger samples. In general,
these correlations appear to be a simple way to determine tortuosity
and the effective diffusion coefficient from easy to determine rock
porosity values.},

One is the effective diffusivity that is required to model the mass transport at the representative element volume (REV) level of porous electrodes in the framework of Darcy's law, while the other is the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient for modeling the mass transport from the REV level to the solid surfaces of pores induced by redox reactions. Based on the theoretical framework of mass transport through the electrodes of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), unique experimental setups for electrochemically determining the two transport properties by measuring limiting current densities are devised. The effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient through the porous electrode made of graphite felt, a typical material for VRFB electrodes, are measured at different electrolyte flow rates. The correlation equations, respectively, for the effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient are finally proposed based on the experimental data.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract Several recent experimental and numerical investigations
have contributed to the improved understanding of the electrochemical
mechanisms taking place at solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes
and yielded valuable information on the relationships between alterable
parameters (geometry/material) and the cathodic polarization resistance.
Efforts to reduce the polarization resistance in SOFCs can benefit
from these results, and some important aspects of the corresponding
studies are reviewed. Experimental results, particularly measurements
using geometrically well-defined Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) cathodes,
are discussed. In regard to simulations, the different levels of
sophistication used in SOFC electrode modeling studies are summarized
and compared. Exemplary simulations of mixed conducting cathodes
that show the capabilities and limits of different modeling levels
are described.},

The purpose of this work is to investigate the effects of the microstructure characteristics of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and microporous layer (MPL), including pore size distribution, hydrophobic treatment, gas permeability, and other factors, on the water management and performance of a PEM fuel cell. A commercial catalyst-coated membrane with an active area of 25cm2 is used along with a GDL and an MPL for assembling a single cell. The effects of the MPL, the thickness of the MPL, the PTFE loading of carbon paper and MPL, and the baking time of the MPL have been investigated. Results show that the addition of MPL increases cell performance in the high current density region due to the elimination of mass transfer limitation. There exists an optimum thickness of MPL. Furthermore, increasing the MPL baking time enhances cell performance due to enlarged pore size and permeability.},

The different pathways for discharge and charge are consistent with the widely observed voltage gap in Li-O(2) cells. Oxidation of C(3)H(6)(OCO(2)Li)(2) involves terminal carbonate groups leaving behind the OC(3)H(6)O moiety that reacts to form a thick gel on the Li anode. Li(2)CO(3), HCO(2)Li, CH(3)CO(2)Li, and C(3)H(6)(OCO(2)Li)(2) accumulate in the cathode on cycling correlating with capacity fading and cell failure.

abstract = {Lithium-oxygen chemistry offers the highest energy density for a rechargeable system as a "lithium-air battery". Most studies of lithium-air batteries have focused on demonstrating battery operations in pure oxygen conditions; such a battery should technically be described as a "lithium-dioxygen battery". Consequently, the next step for the lithium-"air" battery is to understand how the reaction chemistry is affected by the constituents of ambient air. Among the components of air, CO2 is of particular interest because of its high solubility in organic solvents and it can react actively with O2(-•), which is the key intermediate species in Li-O2 battery reactions. In this work, we investigated the reaction mechanisms in the Li-O2/CO2 cell under various electrolyte conditions using quantum mechanical simulations combined with experimental verification. Our most important finding is that the subtle balance among various reaction pathways influencing the potential energy surfaces can be modified by the electrolyte solvation effect. Thus, a low dielectric electrolyte tends to primarily form Li2O2, while a high dielectric electrolyte is effective in electrochemically activating CO2, yielding only Li2CO3. Most surprisingly, we further discovered that a high dielectric medium such as DMSO can result in the reversible reaction of Li2CO3 over multiple cycles. We believe that the current mechanistic understanding of the chemistry of CO2 in a Li-air cell and the interplay of CO2 with electrolyte solvation will provide an important guideline for developing Li-air batteries. Furthermore, the possibility for a rechargeable Li-O2/CO2 battery based on Li2CO3 may have merits in enhancing cyclability by minimizing side reactions.},

abstract = {A transient one-dimensional model for the coupled performance of the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) and the gas-diffusion layer (GDL) in a PEM fuel cell is linearized and an exact analytical solution for the cathode side impedance Z is derived. The solution is valid at a low current density, when the proton and oxygen transport losses in the CCL are not large. The zero-frequency resistance contains the faradaic term, the terms due to the proton and oxygen transport in the CCL and due to the oxygen transport in the GDL. The analytical equation for Z is fast enough for least-squares fitting of experimental spectra, which yields the GDL oxygen diffusivity, the Tafel slope of the oxygen reduction reaction, and the CCL proton conductivity and oxygen diffusivity. As an example, the model is fitted to three measured spectra of a high-temperature PEMFC; the fitting parameters are discussed.},

abstract = {Models have previously been developed and published to predict the steady-state performance of solid polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). In general, such models have been formulated for particular fuel cells and have not been easily applicable to cells with different characteristics, dimensions, etc. The development of a generic model is described here that will accept as input not only values of the operating variables such as anode and cathode feed gas, pressure and compositions, cell temperature and current density, but also cell parameters including active area and membrane thickness. A further feature of the model is the addition of a term to account for membrane ageing. This term is based on the idea that the water-carrying capacity of the membrane deteriorates with time in service. The resulting model is largely mechanistic, with most terms being derived from theory or including coefficients that have a theoretical basis. The major nonmechanistic term is the ohmic overvoltage that is primarily empirically based. The model is applied to several sets of published data for various cells which used platinum as the anode catalyst. Data for various PEM cell designs were well correlated by the model. The lack of agreement of the model predictions with some experimental results may be due to differences in the characteristics of the electrocatalyst. The value of such a generic model to predict or correlate PEM fuel cell voltages is discussed.},

in custom-fabricated quartz nanochannels using quantitative epifluorescence
imaging and current monitoring techniques. One aim is to yield insight
into electrical double layer physics and study the applicability
of continuum theory to nanoscale electrokinetic systems. A second
aim is to explore a new separation modality offered by nanoscale
electrophoretic separations. We perform parametric variations of
applied electric field, channel depth, background buffer concentration,
and species valence to impose variations on zeta potential, effective
mobility, and Debye length among other parameters. These measurements
were used to validate a continuum theory-based analytical model presented
in the first of this two-paper series. Our results confirm the usefulness
of continuum theory in predicting electrokinetic transport and electrophoretic
separations in nanochannels. Our model leverages independent measurements
of zeta potential performed in a microchannel system at electrolyte
concentrations of interest. These data yield a zeta potential versus
concentration relation that is used as a boundary condition for the
nanochannel electrokinetic transport model. The data and model comparisons
together show that the effective mobility governing electrophoretic
transport of charged species in nanochannels depends not only on
ion mobility values but also on the shape of the electric double
layer and analyte ion valence. We demonstrate a method we term electrokinetic
separation by ion valence, whereby both ion valence and mobility
may be determined independently from a comparison of micro- and nanoscale

abstract = {We show analytically that the water-crossover flux through the membrane used for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) can be in situ determined by measuring the water flow rate at the exit of the cathode flow field. This measurement method enables investigating the effects of various design and geometric parameters as well as operating conditions, such as properties of cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL), membrane thickness, cell current density, cell temperature, methanol solution concentration, oxygen flow rate, etc., on water crossover through the membrane in situ in a DMFC. Water crossover through the membrane is generally due to electro-osmotic drag, diffusion and back convection. The experimental data showed that diffusion dominated the total water-crossover flux at low current densities due to the high water concentration difference across the membrane. With the increase in current density, the water flux by diffusion decreased, but the flux by back convection increased. The corresponding net water-transport coefficient was also found to decrease with current density. The experimental results also showed that the use of a hydrophobic cathode GDL with a hydrophobic MPL could substantially reduce water crossover through the membrane, and thereby significantly increasing the limiting current as the result of the improved oxygen transport. It was found that the cell operating temperature, oxygen flow rate and membrane thickness all had significant influences on water crossover, but the influence of methanol concentration was negligibly small.},

The analytical model, fed with input parameters calculated by DFT, is shown to give symmetry factors in reasonable agreement with those of the full-scale DFT model.

adsorption over a wide pressure range. It was shown that, although
active carbons under study show appreciable differences in the BET
specific surface area and the total pore volume, they exhibit quite
similar porous properties. All samples were shown to possess a considerable
amount of small micropores (ca. 0.7 nm). However, the active carbons
have markedly different amounts of larger micropores (width above
ca. 1 nm) and mesopores. It was shown that simple comparative methods,
such as the high resolution alphas plot, provide valuable information
about structural properties of active carbons. However, reliable
adsorption data for suitable reference adsorbents need to be available
in order to successfully apply the comparative methods. Therefore,
a nitrogen adsorption isotherm was measured on a Cabot BP 280 nongraphitized
carbon black over a relative pressure range from 10(-6) to 0.99 and
the resulting data (104 points) are reported in a tabular form. In
the high pressure region (relative pressure from 0.1 to 0.7), the
isotherm for the BP 280 sample exhibits a good agreement with the
reference data available in the literature. Moreover, the adsorption
isotherm currently reported covers the low pressure range, which
is crucial in profound characterization of porous and nonporous solids

abstract = {An electrolyte partially-wetted cathode for Li-air batteries has been studied in this work. By evaporation of diethyl ether from the organic electrolyte, the cathode is partially filled with electrolyte. Compared to conventional flooded cathodes, a partially wetted cathode allows the gaseous oxygen to penetrate fast into the interior part of the porous cathode for the electrochemical reaction. The effective electrode area for oxygen reduction is increased which enhances the cathode kinetics. Using typical cathode materials, the partially wetted cathodes present a 60{\%} higher discharge capacity at 0.1 mA cm- 2 and one magnitude higher rate capability than the flooded cathode. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A macrohomogeneous model that was studied in a previous publication under stationary conditions is used to calculate the small-signal dynamic response of the cathode catalyst layer in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Within this approach the effects of reaction kinetics and double layer capacitance at the dispersed catalyst|electrolyte interface, proton conductivity of the electrolyte network within the layer and oxygen diffusion through the gas-pore space are studied. The analytical expressions derived reveal relationships between the structure of the layer and impedance spectra. Particularly strong dependences of the differential resistivity on the electrode composition appear if either proton transport or oxygen diffusion dominate the voltage losses. This happens for compositions that are close to the percolation thresholds of either proton conductivity in the electrolyte network or gas-pore diffusivity. Due to proton transport limitations, a linear branch is seen in impedance spectra in the high frequency limit, whereas in the low frequency domain a semicircular part arises. These results may help to distinguish the contribution of the catalyst layer from the contribution of other fuel cell components and characterize it quantitatively.},

Characteristic variables related to the water uptake are discussed. A Butler–Volmer formulation of the current-overpotential relationship is developed based on an elementary mechanism of electrochemical oxygen reduction. Validated by using published V–I experiments, the model is then used to analyze the effects of operating conditions on current output and water management, especially net water transport coefficient along the channel. For a power PEMFC, the long-channel configuration is helpful for internal humidification and anode water removal, operating in counterflow mode with proper gas flow rate and humidity. In time domain, a typical transient process with closed anode is also investigated.},

abstract = {An analytical model is developed for the discharge voltage of Li–air batteries with mixed organic/aqueous electrolyte and used to analyze the effects of the oxygen dissolution, solubility, pressure, and diffusivity, reaction rates, and internal resistance on the power density of Li–air batteries. By carefully identifying the model parameters using experimental data it is shown that, for discharge currents above 25 mA cm−2 the power of these batteries is mainly limited by the large internal resistance of the membrane and membrane/electrolyte interfaces (which is currently larger than 100 $\Omega$ cm2), while for smaller discharge currents the power is limited by the low oxygen concentration at the reaction sites. The maximum power density can be increased by approximately 1.5 times if the internal resistance is decreased from 100 $\Omega$ cm2 to 25 $\Omega$ cm2. This relatively small increase in the power density is due to the low dissolution rate and solubility of the oxygen in the liquid electrolyte. Finally, when the battery is operated at maximum discharge power, the oxygen diffusion length in the aqueous electrolyte is under 1 $\mu$m, which shows that one needs to use partly wet cathodes in order to achieve high power densities in these batteries.},

The MD simulated values of Di,self are compared with estimations of the commonly used Bosanquet formula 1/Di,self=1/Di,Kn+1/Ðii,fl, that combines molecule–wall and molecule–molecule interactions:, where Di,Kn is the Knudsen diffusivity, and Ðii,fl is the self-diffusivity of species i in the fluid phase at the same molar concentration, ci, as within the mesopores. For components with poor adsorption strength, such as H2, the MD simulated Di,self values are in good agreement with the estimations using the Bosanquet formula for the whole range of pore concentrations. For components with strong adsorption at the pore walls, the MD simulated values are significantly lower than the Bosanquet estimations when molecule–wall interactions are dominant. These deviations are traceable to the failure of the Knudsen prescription of diffuse reflectance on molecule–wall collisions, because adsorption at the pore walls introduces a bias in the molecular hops. For any given molecule, the Bosanquet estimations tend to be increasingly accurate when the pore diameters are increased.},

abstract = {Local dynamics and hydrogen bonding in CsH2PO4 have been investigated by 1H, 2H, and 31P solid-state NMR spectroscopy to help provide a detailed understanding of proton conduction in the paraelectric phase. Two distinct environments are observed by 1H and 2H NMR, and their chemical shifts (1H) and quadrupolar coupling constants (2H) are consistent with one strong and one slightly weaker H-bonding environment. Two different protonic motions are detected by variable-temperature 1H MAS NMR and T 1 spin-lattice relaxation time measurements in the paraelectric phase, which we assign to librational and long-range translational motions. An activation energy of 0.70 ± 0.07 eV is extracted for the latter motion; that of the librational motion is much lower. 31P NMR line shapes are measured under MAS and static conditions, and spin-lattice relaxation time measurements have been performed as a function of temperature. Although the 31P line shape is sensitive to the protonic motion, the reorientation of the phosphate ions does not lead to a significant change in the 31P CSA tensor. Rapid protonic motion and rotation of the phosphate ions is seen in the superprotonic phase, as probed by the T1 measurements along with considerable line narrowing of both the 1H and the 31P NMR signals. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a nondestructive technique often used to understand the interfacial behavior in electrochemical systems. The ability of the technique to segregate various processes, i.e., ohmic conduction, charge transfer interfacial charging, mass transfer etc, makes it an elegant technique for electrochemical systems. Its applicability to lithium ion cells is further enhanced by the fact that surface films cover both the electrodes and especially the carbon anode. This paper describes the EIS response of individual electrodes in the lithium. ion cells under a variety of experimental conditions, i.e., temperature, high temperature storage and cycling},

@article{Santamaria2012,
abstract = {A theoretical treatment of a Schottky barrier dynamic response is developed on the basis of a general model of a semiconductor with thickness comparable in length to the space charge region width. It is shown that, when the space charge region approaches the metal/semiconductor interface, the electric field at this interface, induced by the charge accumulated on the metal, becomes significant with respect to the electric field induced by the charge accumulated on the semiconductor. Under this condition, the total capacitance of the Schottky barrier becomes independent of the polarization potential and tends to the value $\epsilon$/L, like in a pure dielectric insulator. The term thin film is intended to be with respect to the screening length, which is a function of the volumetric charge density. In amorphous materials the transition potential at which the semiconducting to insulating behaviour is observed is dependent on the frequency. An approximated analytical solution for the capacitance of the junction is calculated. The model for finite thickness semiconductors is successfully applied to the study of anodic Nb(2)O(5), formed in phosphate buffer 0.5 M aqueous solution up to different formation potentials (namely 5, 10 and 20 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The finite thickness semiconductor model permits extrapolation to a general behaviour of the oxide in a wide range of frequencies, potentials and thicknesses, and identification of the electron transfer between adsorbed surface species and the conduction band of Nb(2)O(5) at potentials near to the flat band value.},

abstract = {The effect of stoichiometric ratio $\lambda$ on performance of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell is rationalized. $\lambda$→∞ corresponds to uniform oxygen concentration along the channel; the limiting current density then is determined by transport of oxygen across the cell. Finite $\lambda$ corresponds to decreasing oxygen concentration along the channel. In that case j-axis of a voltage–current plot is “compressed” by a factor f$\lambda$=−$\lambda$ln(1−1/$\lambda$) and apparent value of limiting current density appears to be f$\lambda$ times lower. The function f$\lambda$→∞ as $\lambda$→1; physically, in this limit all available oxygen is consumed close to the channel inlet and apparent limiting current tends to zero. Recently derived expression for the voltage–current curve of the cell is extended to take into account the effect of $\lambda$. Fitting of experimental voltage–current curves with the new relation gives an estimate of basic parameters of the cell.},

In the present paper, the TLM is applied to the impedance analysis

carbon is used as electrode material for electric double layer capacitor
and its pore has branch structure. Considering the fractal structure
of the activated carbon, we proposed new equivalent circuit with
TLM for three sizes of pores: macropore, mesopore and micropore.
In this model, we defined the ratio ?? of electric double layer parts
in whole inner wall of the pore because the inner wall is separated
to electrolyte/electrode interface and branch base parts. Calculated
electrochemical impedance of blocking electrode shows the lumped
constant region in low frequency range and the distributed constant
region in low frequency range. General TLM yields the straight line
with slope of 45?? in the distributed constant region on the Nyquist
plots. In the present analysis, it was found that the slope was 22.5??

abstract = {The properties of the solid-phase redox end members, $\alpha$-S, ?-S, Li2S, and Li2S2, are expected to strongly influence the performance of lithium?sulfur batteries. Nevertheless, the fundamental thermodynamic and electronic properties of these phases remain poorly understood. From a computational standpoint, the absence of these data can be explained by the omission of long-ranged van der Waals interactions in conventional density functionals; these interactions are essential for describing the molecular-crystal nature of S-based compounds. Here we apply van der Waals augmented density functional theory (vdW-DF), quasi-particle methods (G0W0), and continuum solvation techniques to predict several structural, thermodynamic, spectroscopic, electronic, and surface characteristics of these phases. The stability of the $\alpha$ allotrope of sulfur at low temperatures is confirmed by calculating the sulfur phase diagram. Similarly, the stability of lithium persulfide, Li2S2, a compound whose presence may limit capacity, was assessed by comparing the energies of several hypothetical A2B2 crystal structures. In all cases Li2S2 is predicted to be unstable with respect to a two-phase mixture of Li2S and $\alpha$-S, suggesting that Li2S2 is a metastable phase. Regarding surface properties, the stable surfaces and equilibrium crystallite shapes of Li2S and $\alpha$-S were predicted in the presence and absence of a continuum solvation field intended to mimic the effect of a dimethoxyethane (DME)-based electrolyte. In the case of Li2S, the equilibrium crystallites are comprised entirely of stoichiometric (111) surfaces, while for $\alpha$-S a complex mixture of several facets is predicted. Finally, G0W0 calculations reveal that all of $\alpha$-S, ?-S, Li2S, and Li2S2 are insulators with band gaps greater than 2.5 eV.},

@article{Wilson1995,
abstract = {Low platinum loading catalyst layers for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) consist of a thin film of highly inter-mixed ionomer and catalyst that is applied to the electrolyte membrane. High performances are achieved with loadings as low as 0.12 mg Pt cm−2 at the cathode and even lower loadings are required at the anode. However, the long-term performance of these fuel cells depends upon the structural integrity of the recast, ionomer-bound catalyst layers. The discovery that the inclusion of large cations through a simple ion-exchange process renders perfluorosulfonate ionomers moderately melt-processable is exploited to significantly improve the structural integrity of the catalyst layers. When the thermoplastic form of the solubilized ionomer is used in the membrane catalyzation process, the reproducibility is greatly improved and the long-term performance losses are quite low. Overall, the fuel cells demonstrate less than 10{\%} loss in maximum power over almost 4000 h. An indication of the durability of the catalyst layer and the integrity of the catalyst layer/membrane interface is provided by the high tolerance of such fuel cells to shut-down/start-up and freeze-thaw cycles. Various other aspects of endurance testing and overall operation of such PEFCs are also discussed.},

@article{Wang2012f,
abstract = {Lithium-air batteries show a great promise in electrochemical energy
storage with their theoretical specific energy comparable to gasoline.
Discharge products such as Li 2O 2 or Li 2CO 3 are insoluble in several
major nonaqueous electrolytes, and consequently precipitate at the
reaction sites. These materials are also low in electric conductivity.
As a result, the reduced pore space and electrode passiviation increase
the reaction resistance and consequently reduce discharge voltage
and capability. This work presents a modeling study of discharge
product precipitation and effects for lithium-air batteries. Theoretical
analysis is also performed to evaluate the variations of important
quantities including temperature, species concentrations, and electric
potentials. Precipitation growth modes on planar, cylindrical and
spherical surfaces are discussed. A new approach, following the study
of ice formation in PEM fuel cells, is proposed. Validation is carried
out against experimental data in terms of discharge voltage loss.

abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are of great interest to the automotive industry due to their higher power and energy density, higher cell voltage, longer cycle life and lower self-discharge compared to other battery chemistries. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a powerful tool employed to investigate the fundamental electrochemical reactions within a Li-ion battery cell, which relates to state of charge, internal temperature and state of health. Its effectiveness has established it as a core method to study electrochemical behaviour of batteries in both off-line and on-line applications. In this work it is shown that in addition to state of charge, internal temperature and state of health, the time period between the removal of an electrical load and the impedance measurement affects the results. The study of five commercially available cells of varying capacities and electrode chemistries show that, regardless of cell type, maximum impedance change takes place within the first 4 h of the relaxation period. The root cause of this impedance change has been discussed from an electrochemical perspective.},

The same ratio is observed in cyclic voltammetry experiments with low scan rate (<1 mV/s). However, at higher scan rates, the ratio increases as a result of oxygen transport limitations in the electrolyte.

Furthermore, these materials have potentially lower methanol cross-over when compared to standard Nafion-type membranes. In this work, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) have been prepared from such membranes according to the thin-film method. The catalyst layer was spray-coated directly on the heated membrane using an ink consisting of an aqueous suspension of catalyst powder and Nafion solution. Unsupported catalysts were used for anode and cathode. A rather high catalyst loading was chosen in order to minimize the effects of limited catalyst utilization due to flooding conditions at both electrodes.},

abstract = {Using a simple thermal method, a non-noble metal electrocatalyst (Co-N-S/C)
is successfully synthesized and its{\{}'{\}} composition is analyzed using
EDX. The electrochemical activity of such a catalyst is also tested
using surface electrochemical methods. Three one-electron transfer
redox processes in the studied potential range are identified, where
only one such a process is associated with the catalyst{\{}'{\}}s ORR activity.
The effect of KOH on the Co-N-S/C catalyzed ORR kinetics is investigated
using the rotating disk electrode technique in a concentration range
of 0.05 to 6.0M. Several ORR kinetic parameters such as overall electron
transfer number (n), the product of electron transfer number and
coefficient in ORR rate determining step ( ? n ), and the exchange
current density ? ( o i O H O ) are estimated. The results show that
values of n at different KOH concentrations are close to 2 / 2 4.0,
suggesting that Co-N-S/C catalyzed ORR is a 4-electron transfer process
from O2 to H2O. KOH concentration has an insignificant effect on
the value of n, however, a significant effect is observed on both
values of ? n ? ? ? and o i O H O . ( n 2 / ? ? decreases while that
of o i O H O increases with increasing KOH 2 / 2 2 concentration).},

abstract = {We report measurements of local current distribution in a direct methanol fuel cell with single straight channels and segmented electrodes. The experiments directly confirm the existence of a bifunctional regime of DMFC operation: at low air flow rate the segments located close to the inlet of the oxygen channel generate current (galvanic domain), while the other segments consume current to produce hydrogen (electrolytic domain). The cell voltage in this regime in not a single-valued function of current in the external load. The electrolytic domain disappears at a critical air flow rate, which does not depend on current in the cell. We show that a model (A.A. Kulikovsky, Electrochem. Commun. 6 (2004) 1259) explains this critical behavior. Finally, we extend the method of measurement of methanol crossover rate suggested by Ye and Zhao (J. Electrochem. Soc. 152 (2005) A2238) to the case of arbitrary current in the load.},

The electrode model is represented by a transmission line equivalent circuit, and the theory is further generalized by including an arbitrary time delay (a hindrance) of the charge transfer process at the pore surface. A reformulation leads to the definition of an appropriate dielectric function. Two hindrance processes are considered, namely control of the charge transfer by finite diffusion and control by both diffusion and formation of a pseudocapacity (ie charge storage) on a molecular scale. The resulting impedance characteristics for selected parameter values are discussed and preliminary results of fitting experimental data with the new theory are presented.},

A study of the impedance response of a 150 cm2 six-cell air/H2 PEM fuel cell as a function of inlet gas relative humidity was carried out. Parameters of a Randles-like equivalent circuit were then fitted to the data. In order to improve the quality of the fit, the classical Randles cell was extended by changing the standard plane capacitor into a constant phase element (CPE). It was found that monitoring the evolution of the three resistances of this modified Randles model was an efficient and robust way of monitoring the state-of-health (SOH) of the fuel cell with respect to the water content of the membrane electrode assembly. Moreover, the non-integer power of the CPE was found to be statistically constant over a wide range of operating conditions, thus comforting the assumption that it has a physical meaning. Qualitative interpretation of the variation of the parameters as a function of the SOH is proposed in both flooded and dry conditions. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Li-air batteries are attracting much attention because of their relatively high theoretical energy densities compared to other types of batteries and storage devices. This interest in this area is driven not only by industries requiring high electric power such as the electric car industry who requires fundamental improvements in the current Li-ion technology in order to extend the driving range of current electric vehicles, but also by many low-power and portable electronics industries which require light, high-capacity energy storage devices. In this article we first make a comparative analysis between modeling and simulation (M{\&}S) of semiconductor devices and the M{\&}S of electrochemical systems, then discuss about the potential and limitations of Li-air batteries and show how computer simulations can help increasing even more the energy density and overcome some of the limitations of these batteries.},

abstract = {An in-depth insight in the role of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and its impact on the water management is a key issue for the optimization of fuel cells. A new ex situ test method is developed to investigate the water transport in gas diffusion media for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This research is focused on properties of GDLs, which influence the water removal and water retention in the cell. Gas diffusion media are evaluated ex situ in terms of liquid water and water vapor transport employing a conventional PEMFC setup. The amount of water transported through a GDL and out of the cell is determined by the properties of the gas diffusion medium. GDL properties such as the GDL thickness have a significant impact on water transport behavior. Furthermore, high impregnation weight or an additional micro-porous layer (MPL) reduces water removal due to enhanced mass transport resistances. The composition and distribution of the impregnation material in the GDL substrate also play a crucial role. Water transport rates depend not only on the GDL properties but increase exponentially with cell temperature. Finally, a two-phase water transport model is proposed taking into account both diffusive gas phase and liquid water transport in diffusion media. Based on this model, ex situ data set in correlation with in situ performance in PEMFCs on dry operating conditions and guidelines towards new design concepts for gas diffusion media are deduced.},

abstract = {Gas diffusion layers (GDLs) were fabricated using non-woven carbon paper as a macro-porous layer substrate developed by Hollingsworth {\&} Vose Company. A commercially viable coating process was developed using wire rod for coating micro-porous layer by a single pass. The thickness as well as carbon loading in the micro-porous layer was controlled by selecting appropriate wire thickness of the wire rod. Slurry compositions with solid loading as high as 10wt.{\%} using nano-chain and nano-fiber type carbons were developed using dispersion agents to provide cohesive and homogenous micro-porous layer without any mud-cracking. The surface morphology, wetting characteristics and pore size distribution of the wire rod coated GDLs were examined using FESEM, Goniometer and Hg porosimetry, respectively. The GDLs were evaluated in single cell PEMFC under various operating conditions (temperature and RH) using hydrogen and air as reactants. It was observed that the wire rod coated micro-porous layer with 10wt.{\%} nano-fibrous carbon based GDLs showed the highest fuel cell performance at 85°C using H2 and air at 50{\%} RH, compared to all other compositions.},

abstract = {Li–air is a novel battery technology with the potential to offer very
high specific energy, but which currently suffers from a large charging
overpotential and low power density. In this work, we use ab initio
calculations to demonstrate that a facile mechanism for recharging
Li2O2 exists. Rather than the direct decomposition pathway of Li2O2
into Li and O2 suggested by equilibrium thermodynamics, we find an
alternative reaction pathway based on topotactic delithiation of
Li2O2 to form off-stoichiometric Li2–xO2 compounds akin to the charging
mechanism in typical Li-ion intercalation electrodes. The low formation
energy of bulk Li2–xO2 phases confirms that this topotactic delithiation
mechanism is rendered accessible at relatively small overpotentials
of ∼0.3–0.4 V and is likely to be kinetically favored over Li2O2
decomposition. Our findings indicate that at the Li2O2 particle level
there are no obstacles to increase the current density, and point
to an exciting opportunity to create fast charging Li–air...},

abstract = {Non-aqueous Li-air or Li-O(2) cells show considerable promise as a very high energy density battery couple. Such cells, however, show sudden death at capacities far below their theoretical capacity and this, among other problems, limits their practicality. In this paper, we show that this sudden death arises from limited charge transport through the growing Li(2)O(2) film to the Li(2)O(2)-electrolyte interface, and this limitation defines a critical film thickness, above which it is not possible to support electrochemistry at the Li(2)O(2)-electrolyte interface. We report both electrochemical experiments using a reversible internal redox couple and a first principles metal-insulator-metal charge transport model to probe the electrical conductivity through Li(2)O(2) films produced during Li-O(2) discharge. Both experiment and theory show a "sudden death" in charge transport when film thickness is {\~{}}5 to 10 nm. The theoretical model shows that this occurs when the tunneling current through the film can no longer support the electrochemical current. Thus, engineering charge transport through Li(2)O(2) is a serious challenge if Li-O(2) batteries are ever to reach their potential.},

To maintain the MEA with a satisfactory water content and distribution, a novel gas diffusion layer (GDL) was designed by inserting a water management layer (WML) between the traditional GDL and the catalyst layer of the PEMFC. A simulator was developed for the optimization of the GDL, where the water distribution in the electrode and the profile of the water transport in the polymer membrane could be predicted. For this purpose, the water vapor permeability of the GDL, which was the main variable, was investigated under conditions similar to the PEMFC. Furthermore, the cell performance of the PEMFC with the GDL was tested. The testing results indicated that the water management in the MEA could be significantly improved by using the WML.},

abstract = {The influence of the anode and cathode GDL wettability on the current and media distribution was studied using combined in situ high resolution neutron radiography and locally resolved current distribution measurements. MEAs were prepared by vertically splitting either the anode or cathode carbon cloth into a less hydrophobic part (untreated carbon cloth ‘as received’) and a more hydrophobic part (carbon cloth impregnated by PTFE dispersion). Both parts were placed side by side to obtain a complete electrode and hot-pressed with a Nafion membrane. MEAs with partitioned anode carbon cloth revealed no difference between the untreated and the hydrophobised part of the cell concerning the fluid and current distribution. The power generation of both parts was almost equal and the cell performance was similar to that of an undivided MEA (110mWcm−2, 300mAcm−2, 70°C). In contrast, MEAs with partitioned cathode carbon cloth showed a better performance for the hydrophobised part, which contributed to about 60{\%} of the overall power generation. This is explained by facilitated oxygen transport especially in the hydrophobised part of the cathode gas diffusion layer. At an average current density of 300mAcm−2, a pronounced flooding of the cathode flow field channels adjacent to the untreated part of GDL led to a further loss of performance in this part of the cell. The low power density of the untreated part caused a significant loss of cell performance, which amounted to less than 40mWcm−2 (at 300mAcm−2).},

from 13C NMR chemical shifts and spin?lattice relaxation (T1) times
of 13C*O in solutions of these charged ions in propylene carbonate

This excellent performance is attributed to the unique bimodal porous

facilitating rapid O(2) diffusion while the highly connected nanoscale
pores provide a high density of reactive sites for Li-O(2) reactions.
Further, we show that the defects and functional groups on graphene

help prevent air blocking in the air electrode. The hierarchically
ordered porous structure in bulk graphene enables its practical applications
by promoting accessibility to most graphene sheets in this structure.},

abstract = {This analysis evaluates several operational benefits of electricity
storage, including load-leveling, spinning contingency reserves,
and regulation reserves. Storage devices were simulated in a utility
system in the western United States, and the operational costs of
generation was compared to the same system without the added storage.
This operational value of storage was estimated for devices of various
sizes, providing different services, and with several sensitivities
to fuel price and other factors. Overall, the results followed previous
analyses that demonstrate relatively low value for load-leveling
but greater value for provision of reserve services. The value was
estimated by taking the difference in operational costs between cases
with and without energy storage and represents the operational cost
savings from deploying storage by a traditional vertically integrated
utility. The analysis also estimated the potential revenues derived
from a merchant storage plant in a restructured market, based on
marginal system prices. Due to suppression of on-/off-peak price
differentials and incomplete capture of system benefits (such as
the cost of power plant starts), the revenue obtained by storage
in a market setting appears to be substantially less than the net
benefit provided to the system. This demonstrates some of the additional
challenges for storage deployed in restructured energy markets.},

@article{Pasaogullari2004,
abstract = {Two-phase transport of reactants and products constitutes an important limit in performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC). Particularly, at high current densities and/or low gas flow rates, product water condenses in open pores of the cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) and limits the effective oxygen transport to the active catalyst sites. Furthermore, liquid water covers some of the active catalytic surface, rendering them inactive for electrochemical reaction. Traditionally, these two-phase transport processes in the GDL are modeled using so-called unsaturated flow theory (UFT), in which a uniform gas-phase pressure is assumed across the entire porous layer, thereby ignoring the gas-phase flow counter to capillarity-induced liquid motion. In this work, using multi-phase mixture (M2) formalism, the constant gas pressure assumption is relaxed and the effects of counter gas-flow are studied and found to be a new oxygen transport mechanism. Further, we analyze the multi-layer diffusion media, composed of two or more layers of porous materials having different pore sizes and/or wetting characteristics. Particularly, the effects of porosity, thickness and wettability of a micro-porous layer (MPL) on the two-phase transport in PEFC are elucidated.},

abstract = {Iron oxide and iron oxyhydroxide particles, particularly, the goethite
$\alpha$-FeOOH phase, are environmentally friendly materials and
are used in various technological applications as adsorbents, precursors
of Fe powders for magnetic recording media, and pigments. In this
work, the formation process of $\alpha$-FeOOH by air oxidation of
Fe(OH)2 suspensions has been studied. The effects of the air flow
rate, as well as of the reactant concentration ratio, R (=[(OH)?]/[Fe(II)]),
on the reaction product were analyzed. It has been found that the
morphology and the size of the $\alpha$-FeOOH particles can be modified
by means of the air flow rate. Furthermore, by performing a detailed
microscopic analysis of the morphology of the initial, intermediate,
and final reaction products, we have obtained evidence of epitaxial
growth of $\alpha$-FeOOH on the Fe(OH)2 substrate. It is suggested
that the similarity between the anion arrangements in both phases
facilitates this process. Based on these results, a pathway for the
formation of $\alpha$-FeOOH in highly alkaline medium is proposed
in which the size and shape of the initial Fe(OH)2 particles plays
a significant role in the formation the $\alpha$-FeOOH particles
obtained upon completion of the oxidation process.},

abstract = {Today's unresolved issues in impedance spectroscopy are driven by
the observation that impedance spectroscopy provides only an indirect
characterization of a given system. A consequence of the inferential
character of impedance spectroscopy is that many models can provide
fits that fall within the apparent confidence limits of the data.
Therefore impedance spectroscopy cannot be regarded as being a “stand-alone”
technique. The non-uniqueness of impedance models is currently being
addressed by incorporating independent in-situ and ex-situ analyses
into impedance experiments, by varying additional parameters (or
forcing functions) such as temperature, mass transfer rates, energy
of incident monochromatic illumination and intensity of broad-band
illumination, and by incorporating measurements of additional properties
such as mass. Improvements in interpretation will also be driven
by incorporation of more sophisticated statistical treatment of data

abstract = {A novel fluorescence microscopy technique for visualizing the transport of liquid water in unsaturated hydrophobic fibrous media has been developed and is applied to the gas diffusion layer of a PEM fuel cell. In the experiments, fluorescein dye solution is pumped through the fibrous hydrophobic gas diffusion layer (GDL) and imaged with fluorescence microscopy. Transient image intensity data is correlated to the liquid surface height and is analyzed and presented in the form of three-dimensional reconstructions of the time-evolving gas/liquid interface inside the fibrous structure. The high spatial resolution of the visualization can resolve the dynamic transport of liquid water through distinct pathways, which helps to refine understanding regarding liquid water transport mechanism within these porous layers. The physical observations suggest that the water is not transported via a converging capillary tree as suggested in prior work and models. Rather, transport is dominated by fingering and channeling. Based on the physical insight obtained from the experiments, a new water transport scheme is proposed as the basis for developing improved models for water transport in hydrophobic gas diffusion layers.},

@article{Ganapathy2014,
abstract = {Fundamental research into the Li-O2 battery system has gone into high gear, gaining momentum because of its very high theoretical specific energy. Much progress has been made toward understanding the discharge mechanism, but the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on charge (i.e., oxidation) remains less understood. Here, using operando X-ray diffraction, we show that oxidation of electrochemically generated Li2O2 occurs in two stages, but in one step for bulk crystalline (commercial) Li2O2, revealing a fundamental difference in the OER process depending on the nature of the peroxide. For electrochemically generated Li2O2, oxidation proceeds first through a noncrystalline lithium peroxide component, followed at higher potential by the crystalline peroxide via a Li deficient solid solution (Li(2-x)O2) phase. Anisotropic broadening of the X-ray Li2O2 reflections confirms a platelet crystallite shape. On the basis of the evolution of the broadening during charge, we speculate that the toroid particles are deconstructed one platelet at a time, starting with the smallest sizes that expose more peroxide surface. In the case of in situ charged bulk crystalline Li2O2, the Li vacancies preferentially form on the interlayer position (Li1), which is supported by first-principle calculations and consistent with their lower energy compared to those located next to oxygen (Li2). The small actively oxidizing fraction results in a gradual reduction of the Li2O2 crystallites. The fundamental insight gained in the OER charge mechanism and its relation to the nature of the Li2O2 particles is essential for the design of future electrodes with lower overpotentials, one of the key challenges for high performance Li-air batteries.},

The oxidation of Li8O8 clusters is studied in unbiased DFT-based MD simulations upon removal of either one or two electrons, either in vacuo or immersed in dimethyl sulfoxide solvent molecules with a structure previously optimized by means of classical MD. Whereas removal of one electron leads only to an enhancement of the superoxide character of O-O bonds, removal of two electrons leads to the spontaneous dissolution of either an O2 or a LiO2+ molecule. These results are interpreted in terms of a two-stage process in which a peroxide-to-superoxide transition can take place in amorphous Li2O2 phases at low oxidation potentials, later followed by the dissolution of dioxygen molecules and Li+ ions at higher potentials.},

abstract = {The zinc air fuel cell (ZAFC) is a promising candidate for electrical
energy storage and electric vehicle propulsion. However, its limited
durability has become a major obstacle for its successful commercialization.
In this study, 2-cell stacks, 25 cm² cells and three-electrode half-cells
are constructed to experimentally investigate the degradation characteristics
of the air cathode. The results of electrochemical tests reveal that
the peak power density for the 25 cm2 cell with a new air cathode
is 454 mW cm−2, which is twice as the value of the used air cathode.
The electrochemical impedance analysis shows that both the charge
transfer resistance and the mass transfer resistance of the used
air cathodes have increased, suggesting that the catalyst surface
area and gas diffusion coefficient have decreased significantly.
Additionally, the microstructure and morphology of the catalytic
layer (CL) and gas diffusion layer (GDL) are characterized by scanning
electron microscopes (SEM). SEM results confirm that the micropores
in CL and GDL of the used air cathode are seriously clogged, and
many catalyst particles are lost. Therefore, the performance degradation
is mainly due to the clogging of micropores and loss of catalyst
particles. Furthermore, hypotheses of degradation mechanism and mitigation
strategies for GDL and CL are discussed briefly.},

abstract = {A new type of transfer function is described in this work as a tool to give support to modeling in electrochemical kinetics. It is based on the response analysis with frequency to a sine wave potential modulation applied to an electrode, of a Raman band, the intensity of which is proportional to the response of surface concentration of an adsorbed species. A set-up, consisting of a Raman spectrometer with a CCD detector from which the Raman intensity was defined and extracted to be converted into a tension sent to the input of a multichannel FRA, was implemented. The procedure for extracting the Raman band intensity is explained and was validated by using, as a substitute to the Raman band, a LED light. The method was applied to the study of the polyaniline doping process in a pH range around 3. Five input channels of the FRA were devoted to Raman bands characterizing leucoemeraldine, emeraldine base and/or salt. For pH lower than 3, the concentrations of all moieties are in phase with the charge, while above 3, emeraldine base shows a significant phase lag. This behavior is consistent with a model in progress involving two electrochemical steps and a chemical one. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We develop a density functional theory model for the electrochemical growth and dissolution of Li(2)O(2) on various facets, terminations, and sites (terrace, steps, and kinks) of a Li(2)O(2) surface. We argue that this is a reasonable model to describe discharge and charge of Li-O(2) batteries over most of the discharge-charge cycle. Because non-stoichiometric surfaces are potential dependent and since the potential varies during discharge and charge, we study the thermodynamic stability of facets, terminations, and steps as a function of potential. This suggests that different facets, terminations, and sites may dominate in charge relative to those for discharge. We find very low thermodynamic overpotentials (<0.2 V) for both discharge and charge at many sites on the facets studied. These low thermodynamic overpotentials for both discharge and charge are in very good agreement with the low kinetic overpotentials observed in recent experiments. However, there are other predicted paths for discharge/charge that have higher overpotentials, so the phase space available for the electrochemistry opens up with overpotential.},

abstract = {The direct conversion of hydrogen into electricity by polymer membrane fuel cells (PEFC) is a promising option for future transportation and stationary energy supply systems. A model for heat and water transport in a polymer membrane fuel cell has been developed for evaluation with regard to structure and material. Moreover the dynamic simulation allows simulation of the transient state after changes of electrical load or gas flow rate and humidification. The polymer membrane fuel cell is subdivided into different components: gas distributor, gas diffusion layer, catalytic layer and membrane. Each of these components is described by a mathematical model which accounts for the physical phenomena arising in this structure: i.e. energy and mass transfer and electrochemical kinetics. In the simulation program each component is represented by a separate module. Coupling these modules results in a model describing a single electrode membrane unit or a complete fuel cell stack. Results are presented by current-voltage curves or temperature plots. The influence of model parameters such as thickness and porosity of the diffusion layer, or the structure of the catalytic layer, are shown. Furthermore, results of the dynamic behaviour of a polymer membrane fuel cell are presented.},

Ac impedance analysis revealed that Li-Al electrodes showed relatively

charge-discharge cycling. On the other hand, a Li-Sn electrode gave
higher interfacial resistance than a “pure” Li electrode. Cyclic

test revealed the Li-Al electrode exhibited small polarization from
the ideal redox potential of Li/Li+ during charging and discharging
while the Li-Sn electrode showed relatively large polarization. The
polarization behavior of the various electrodes correlated with the

Most current methods for contact resistance estimation are experimental and there is a lack of well developed theoretical methods. A micro-scale numerical model is developed to predict the electrical contact resistance between BPP and GDL by simulating the BPP surface topology and GDL structure and numerically determining the status for each contact spot. The total resistance and pressure are obtained by considering all contact spots as resistances in parallel and summing the results together. This model shows good agreements with experimental results. Influences of BPP surface roughness parameters on contact resistance are also studied. This model is beneficial in understanding the contact behavior between BPP and GDL and can be integrated with other fuel cell simulations to predict the overall performance of PEM fuel cells.},

abstract = {The usual expression of the finite Warburg element used for analyzing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy spectra is obtained assuming that the reaction occurs at the electrode/membrane interface and that the oxygen concentration at the gas channel/gas diffusion layer interface is constant. A simple improvement of this expression consists in the oxygen concentration depletion along the gas channel. This pseudo-two-dimensional approach should be more appropriate for the investigation of mass transfer limitations in membrane–electrode assemblies of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Starting from experimental data from the literature, numerical simulations show that conclusions about the mass transfer limiting layer and its main characteristics can be significantly modified, which can contribute to a better understanding of oxygen transport in fuel cells. The results also put forward the existence of a critical value of the air stoichiometry below, which, close to the air channel exit, no oxygen can access to the active layer. However, the diffusion impedance model does not take into account time-dependent current variation effects on the gas concentration, although experimental proofs by  Schneider  et al. [ J. Electrochem. Soc. ,  154 ,  B383 (2007) ;  154 ,  B770 (2007)]  brought that they influence significantly the shape and the size of the measured impedance spectra. },

abstract = {During the cycling of Li-O2 batteries the discharge process gives rise to dynamically evolving agglomerates composed of lithium-oxygen nanostructures; however, little is known about their composition. In this paper, we present results for a Li-O2 battery based on an activated carbon cathode that indicate interfacial effects can suppress disproportionation of a LiO2 component in the discharge product. High-intensity X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements are first used to show that there is a LiO2 component along with Li2O2 in the discharge product. The stability of the discharge product was then probed by investigating the dependence of the charge potential and Raman intensity of the superoxide peak with time. The results indicate that the LiO2 component can be stable for possibly up to days when an electrolyte is left on the surface of the discharged cathode. Density functional calculations on amorphous LiO2 reveal that the disproportionation process will be slower at an electrolyte/LiO2 interface compared to a vacuum/LiO2 interface. The combined experimental and theoretical results provide new insight into how interfacial effects can stabilize LiO2 and suggest that these interfacial effects may play an important role in the charge and discharge chemistries of a Li-O2 battery.},

@article{Bazant2009,
abstract = {The venerable theory of electrokinetic phenomena rests on the hypothesis
of a dilute solution of point-like ions in quasi-equilibrium with
a weakly charged surface, whose potential relative to the bulk is
of order the thermal voltage (kT/e approximately 25 mV at room temperature).
In nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC or induced-charge
electro-osmosis (ACEO, ICEO) and induced-charge electrophoresis (ICEP),
several V approximately 100 kT/e are applied to polarizable surfaces
in microscopic geometries, and the resulting electric fields and
induced surface charges are large enough to violate the assumptions
of the classical theory. In this article, we review the experimental
and theoretical literatures, highlight discrepancies between theory
and experiment, introduce possible modifications of the theory, and
analyze their consequences. We argue that, in response to a large
applied voltage, the "compact layer" and "shear plane" effectively
advance into the liquid, due to the crowding of counterions. Using
simple continuum models, we predict two general trends at large voltages:
(i) ionic crowding against a blocking surface expands the diffuse
double layer and thus decreases its differential capacitance, and
(ii) a charge-induced viscosity increase near the surface reduces
the electro-osmotic mobility; each trend is enhanced by dielectric
saturation. The first effect is able to predict high-frequency flow
reversal in ACEO pumps, while the second may explain the decay of
ICEO flow with increasing salt concentration. Through several colloidal
examples, such as ICEP of an uncharged metal sphere in an asymmetric
electrolyte, we show that nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena are
generally ion-specific. Similar theoretical issues arise in nanofluidics
(due to confinement) and ionic liquids (due to the lack of solvent),
so the paper concludes with a general framework of modified electrokinetic
equations for finite-sized ions.},

abstract = {Water flow through carbon cloth and carbon paper gas diffusion media used for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells treated with Teflon was measured. The gas diffusion layer (GDL) media are hydrophobic and it is necessary to apply pressure to force water to penetrate into the pores of these materials. Teflon treatments made the carbon cloth and paper more hydrophobic, no water flowed through the media until pressures of 5–10kPa were applied to overcome the surface energy of the water/Teflon interface in the largest pores. The largest pores were ∼250$\mu$m in the carbon cloth and ∼40$\mu$m in the Toray carbon paper. The largest pores in a catalyst layer applied to the woven carbon cloth were ∼20$\mu$m. Increasing the applied hydrostatic pressure permitted water to flow through smaller pores in the GDL. Water flows through less than 1{\%} of the void volume in the GDL; the small pores remain free of water and permit gas to get to the catalyst layer.},

@article{Walker2013,
abstract = {A major challenge in the development of rechargeable Li-O(2) batteries is the identification of electrolyte materials that are stable in the operating environment of the O(2) electrode. Straight-chain alkyl amides are one of the few classes of polar, aprotic solvents that resist chemical degradation in the O(2) electrode, but these solvents do not form a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li anode. The lack of a persistent SEI leads to rapid and sustained solvent decomposition in the presence of Li metal. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time successful cycling of a Li anode in the presence of the solvent, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), by employing a salt, lithium nitrate (LiNO(3)), that stabilizes the SEI. A Li-O(2) cell containing this electrolyte composition is shown to cycle for more than 2000 h (>80 cycles) at a current density of 0.1 mA/cm(2) with a consistent charging profile, good capacity retention, and O(2) detected as the primary gaseous product formed during charging. The discovery of an electrolyte system that is compatible with both electrodes in a Li-O(2) cell may eliminate the need for protecting the anode with a ceramic membrane.},

First the local effective mass diffusivity of a fibrous diffusion medium is determined as a function of the local porosity and local water saturation, using the network model for species diffusion. Then using this along with the hydrodynamics of capillary, two-phase flow in hydrophobic porous media, the water formation rate (hydrogen–oxygen reaction), and condensation kinetics, the one-dimensional distribution of water saturation is determined and roles of fiber diameter, porosity, and capillary pressure on cell performance are explored. The results point to a two-layer medium (similar to the added conventional microlayer) which is then analyzed for optimum performance.},

abstract = {The thermodynamic stability and electronic structure of 40 surfaces of lithium peroxide (Li(2)O(2)) and lithium oxide (Li(2)O) were characterized using first-principles calculations. As these compounds constitute potential discharge products in Li-oxygen batteries, their surface properties are expected to play a key role in understanding electrochemical behavior in these systems. Stable surfaces were identified by comparing 23 distinct Li(2)O(2) surfaces and 17 unique Li(2)O surfaces; crystallite areal fractions were determined through application of the Wulff construction. Accounting for the oxygen overbinding error in density functional theory results in the identification of several new Li(2)O(2) oxygen-rich 0001 and 1 {\{}{\`{I}}{\}}{\{}$\backslash$ldots{\{}{\}}{\}}100 terminations that are more stable than those previously reported. Although oxygen-rich facets predominate in Li(2)O(2), in Li(2)O stoichiometric surfaces are preferred, consistent with prior studies. Surprisingly, surface-state analyses reveal that the stable surfaces of Li(2)O(2) are half-metallic, despite the fact that Li(2)O(2) is a bulk insulator. Surface oxygens in these facets are ferromagnetic with magnetic moments ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 {\{}$\mu${\}}(B). In contrast, the stable surfaces of Li(2)O are insulating and nonmagnetic. The distinct surface properties of these compounds may explain observations of electrochemical reversibility for systems in which Li(2)O(2) is the discharge product and the irreversibility of systems that discharge to Li(2)O. Moreover, the presence of conductive surface pathways in Li(2)O(2) could offset capacity limitations expected to arise from limited electron transport through the bulk.},

abstract = {Several theoretical models are fitted to an exact wide-frequency-range
data set representing a new random-free-energy, effective-medium
expression for mobile-ion response at low temperatures. A continuous-time,
random-walk K1 model, indirectly involving a stretched-exponential
temporal correlation function, led to the best fit, much superior
to those of two dielectric-dispersion models as well. Two types of
approaches are compared for analyzing 0.4Ca(NO(3))(2).0.6KNO(3) (CKN)
experimental data covering a very wide frequency range: a simplified
conventional approach, usually involving only some or all of the
real part of conductivity, denoted type 1, and an approach involving
nonlinear least-squares fitting of full complex data over its entire
range, denoted type 2. The type-2 analysis uses a composite fitting
model involving the K1 and involves 10 free parameters needed to
well represent electrode polarization, conductive-system dispersion,
nearly constant loss, and limiting far-infrared vibrational effects.
It confirmed that the latter were purely dielectric and led to sigma''
and epsilon'' boson peaks; included a mobile-charge explanation of
the nearly constant loss region; and yielded reasonable values of
the K1-model fractional exponent, beta(1), and plausible values of
a completely blocking double-layer capacitance. The good type-2 fit
parameter estimates were used to generate extrapolated model response
over a 20-decade range at complex conductivity and complex relative
permittivity levels, as well as their accurate slopes over that range.
The maximum slope of the log-log sigma' curve failed to approximate
well the value of 2 usually inferred from data of the present type
but instead led to a novel double peak with peak slope values of
about 1.6 and 1.7 before decreasing to zero at the limiting far-infrared
plateau region of sigma' response. Nearly constant loss was found
to be well described by the series combination of the bulk high-frequency-limiting
dielectric constant of the material and a translational ionic-motion
constant-phase-element expression, one whose inclusion was also needed
for representing low-frequency electrode polarization effects. Further,
this combination should dominate the full response at sufficiently
low temperatures.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-MnO2 nanowires modified with dispersed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-protected Au and Ag nanoclusters (Au-MnO2 and Ag-MnO2) were used for the first time as hybrid oxygen electrocatalysts for nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries. The Au-MnO2 and Ag-MnO2 hybrid catalysts surpassed the performance of pristine $\alpha$-MnO2 nanowires in full-cell tests in the following order: Au-MnO2  Ag-MnO2  pristine $\alpha$-MnO2. Specifically cells with the Au-MnO2 catalyst could reduce the discharge/charge overpotentials at 100 mA g-1 to 0.23/1.02 V and deliver discharge/charge capacities of 5784/5020 mAh g-1. They could also be cycled for at least 60 times at the depth of discharge (DOD) of 1000 mAh g-1. The good full cell performance demonstrated the effectiveness of Au/Ag nanoclusters in promoting oxygen electrocatalysis on $\alpha$-MnO2; forming discharge products with more reactive morphologies. It is therefore worthwhile to explore the use of Au and Ag nanoclusters in other catalyst systems for oxygen electrocatalysis in nonaqueous solution.},

abstract = {In the preparation of electrodes for the proton exchange membrane (PEMFC), the effect of the fabrication method and the thickness of the gas diffusion layer and the impregnation method of Nafion solution on the cell performance was investigated, and unit cell tests were performed. The gas diffusion layer was prepared by rolling, spraying, and screen printing methods, and Nafion solution was impregnated using spraying and brushing methods. The diffusion layer in a PEMFC consists of a thin layer of carbon black mixed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) that is coated onto a sheet of macro-porous carbon backing cloth. The effects of different fabrication methods and thicknesses of gas diffusion layer are discussed in the light of porosimetry and I–V polarization curves and variables related to the electrode analyzed by numerical simulation. The spraying method proved to be more profitable for cell performance than the brushing method for the impregnation of Nafion solution because it reduced the charge transfer resistance and extended the three-phase region. The goals of this work are to find the optimum thickness of the gas diffusion layer and to undertake an analysis of the system.},

Three types of gas diffusion layers were studied at 202 kPa and 353°K. An optimum bolt torque was observed when ELAT® or a combination of CARBEL® and TORAY™ gas diffusion media were used as diffusion layers. The optimum is related to the gasket thickness and the measured compression pressure on the diffusion layer. The performance changes may also be related to changes in the porosity, the electrical contact resistance, and the excluded water at the membrane.},

@article{Griffith2015,
abstract = {The discharge rate is critical to the performance of lithium/oxygen batteries: it impacts both cell capacity and discharge-phase morphology, and in so doing may also affect the efficiency of the oxygen-evolution reaction during recharging. First-discharge data from tens of Li/O2 cells discharged across four rates are analyzed statistically to inform these connections. In the practically significant superficial current-density range of 0.1 to 1 mA cm?2, capacity is found to fall as a power law, with a Peukert?s-law exponent of 1.6 ± 0.1. X-ray diffractometry confirms the dominant presence of crystalline Li2O2 in the discharged electrodes. A completely air-free sample-transfer technique was developed to implement scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the discharge product. SEM imaging of electrodes with near-average capacities provides statistically significant measures of the shape and size variation of electrodeposited Li2O2 particles with respect to discharge current. At lower rates, typical ?toroidal? particles are observed that are well approximated as cylindrical structures, whose average radii remain relatively constant as discharge rate increases, whereas their average heights decrease. At the highest rate studied, air-free SEM shows that particles take needle-like shapes rather than forming the nanosheets or compact films described elsewhere. Average particle volumes decrease with current while particle surface-to-volume ratios increase dramatically, supporting the notion that Li2O2 grows by a locally mass-transfer-limited nucleation and growth mechanism.},

abstract = {Lithium–sulfur (Li/S) cells are promising candidates for a next generation of safe and cost-effective high energy density batteries for mobile and stationary applications. At present, most Li/S cells still suffer from relatively poor cyclability, capacity loss under moderate current densities and self-discharge. Furthermore, the underlying chemical mechanisms of the general discharge/charge behavior as well as Li/S-specific phenomena like the polysulfide shuttle are not yet fully understood. Here we present a thermodynamically consistent, fully reversible continuum model of a Li/S cell with simplified four-step electrochemistry, including a simple description of the polysulfide shuttle effect. The model is parameterized using experimental discharge curves obtained from literature and reproduces behavior at various current densities with fairly high accuracy. While being instructively simple, the presented model can still reproduce distinct macroscopic Li/S-cell features caused by the shuttle effect, e.g., seemingly infinite charging at low charge current densities, and suboptimal coulombic efficiency. The irreversible transport of active material from the cathode to the anode results in a voltage drop and capacity loss during cycling, which can also be observed experimentally.},

abstract = {In polymer electrolyte fuel cells, high humidity must be established to maintain high proton conductivity in the polymer electrolyte. However, the water that is produced electrochemically at the cathode catalyst layer can condense in the cell and cause an obstruction to the diffusion of reaction gas in the gas diffusion layer and the gas channel. This leads to a sudden decrease of the cell voltage. To combat this, strict water management techniques are required, which usually focus on the gas diffusion layer. In this study, the use of specially treated carbon paper as a flood-proof gas diffusion layer under extremely high humidity conditions was investigated experimentally. The results indicated that flooding originates at the interface between the gas diffusion layer and the catalyst layer, and that such flooding could be eliminated by control of the pore size in the gas diffusion layer at this interface.},

@article{Lertviriyapaisan2010,
abstract = {The effect of sublayers on the deposited platinum (Pt) catalyst layer fabricated by electrodeposition, and on the resulting fuel cell performance, was investigated. The substrate was prepared by applying a hydrophobic sublayer, composed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon black, and a hydrophilic sublayer, composed of Nafion and glycerol, onto an uncatalyzed gas diffusion layer prior to the electrodeposition of the Pt catalyst. The hydrophilic sublayer was found to play a substantial role in the Pt electrodeposition, since the structure of the resultant Pt catalyst significantly depended on the presence of the hydrophilic sublayer, the total loading amount and the Nafion to glycerol weight ratio, which in turn affected the fuel cell performance. The hydrophobic sublayer, which did not directly contact with the plating solution, did not show as marked an effect on the Pt deposit structure compared to that of the hydrophilic sublayer, except at high PTFE to carbon black weight ratios (≥70:30). However, the suitable PTFE to carbon black weight ratio in the hydrophobic sublayer was still important for the water management, mass transport of reactant gases and ohmic resistance of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) during fuel cell operation. In this study, a total hydrophilic loading of 0.8 mg cm−2 with a Nafion to glycerol weight ratio of 50:50, and a PTFE to carbon black weight ratio in the hydrophobic sublayer of 30:70 was found to yield the best Pt catalyst layer for PEMFC.},

abstract = {At low air flow rate the active area of a direct methanol fuel cell splits up into galvanic and electrolytic domains: the first one generates current, while the second consumes it to convert methanol to hydrogen. Recent experiments [A.A. Kulikovsky, H. Schmitz, K. Wippermann, Electrochem. Solid State Lett. 10 (2007) B126] suggest that hydrogen can permeate towards the galvanic domain and contribute to current production there. Here we perform analysis of potential distribution in a cell. The analysis shows that between galvanic and electrolytic domains forms the transition region, which can operate as a hydrogen cell. This confirms the conjecture made in the cited paper.},

abstract = {A non-destructive estimation of the state-of-charge (SoC) of batteries facilitates optimum utilization of the battery for a given application, as well as evaluation of its state-of-health. Among various methods, a.c. impedance spectroscopy over a wide range of frequencies provides a variety of parameters which are functions of the SoC of a given battery. These parameters and their variation with SoC depend on the type of battery and on the experimental conditions. The impedance data of sealed commercial cells are rather tedious to analyze since the results are generally the combined parameters of both the positive and the negative electrodes. Separation of the parameters which correspond to the individual electrodes involves assumptions, the validity of which is open to question. Nevertheless, systematic linear and reproducible variations of measurable or computable impedance parameters with battery condition are useful indicators of the SoC in a non-destructive way. The present review consolidates the literature on the prediction of the SoC of batteries by means of a.c. impedance measurements.},

abstract = {In this work, we report a basic study on the mechanism of lithium ion de-insertion/insertion process from/into LiMn2O4 cathode material in aqueous Li2SO4 solution using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). An equivalent circuit distinguishing the kinetic parameters of lithium ion de-insertion/insertion is used to simulate the experimental impedance data. The fitting results are in good agreement with the experimental results and the parameters of the kinetic process of Li+ de-insertion and insertion in LiMn2O4 at different potentials during charge and discharge are obtained using the same circuit. The results indicate that the de-insertion/insertion behavior of lithium ions at LiMn2O4 cathode in Li2SO4 aqueous solution is similar to that reported in the organic electrolytes. The charge transfer resistance (Rct), warburg resistance, double layer capacitance and chemical diffusion coefficient (DLi+) vary with potentials during de-insertion/insertion processes. Rct is lowest at the CV peak potentials and the important kinetic parameter, DLi+ exhibits two distinct minima at potentials corresponding to CV peaks during de-insertion–insertion and it was found to be between 10−8 and 10−10cm2s−1during lithium de-insertion/insertion processes.},

abstract = {The electrochemical behavior of different size gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) was investigated. AuNPs with 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 50 nm diameters
were immobilized onto a screen printed carbon electrode surface by
physical adsorption. The impedimetric response was measured for different
diameter AuNPs at a fixed value of their surface area, at the same
content of gold (Au) and at the same concentration. In a further
experiment, the impedimetric response toward AuNP concentration was
measured for each diameter. Impedimetric results were compared with
results obtained for the detection of Au by stripping voltammetry.
Additionally, variability of active surface area and roughness of
different electrodes before and after immobilization of AuNPs were
carefully evaluated by means of cyclic voltammetry and laser scanning
microscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a sensitive
technique capable of differentiating the signal generated by AuNPs
of different sizes, thus providing useful information for the employment
of AuNPs in electrochemical biosensors.},

It is confirmed that the pore-size distribution of the diffusion layer is a more critical parameter for mass-transport processes within the electrode and for cell performance characteristics than the total porosity itself. Data obtained from mercury intrusion porosimetry, single-cell performance tests and ac impedance analyses indicate that the performance loss due to mass-transport limitations can be reduced by enlarging the macropore volume in the diffusion layer.

@article{Bidault2009,
abstract = {This paper gives a technical background to alkaline fuel cells (AFCs), introducing the advantages and drawbacks of the technology. AFCs offer the potential for low cost, mass producible fuel cells, without the dependency on platinum based catalysts and (currently) expensive membrane electrolytes. The AFC uses relatively low cost electrolytes based on aqueous bases such as potassium hydroxide. The inherent CO2 sensitivity of the electrolyte can be addressed by filtering out the CO2 from the air intake using a simple scrubber and periodically replacing the liquid electrolyte. A review of the state-of-the-art in gas diffusion cathode development is given. The overall cell performance and stability is dominated by the behaviour of the cathode, leading to a focus of research effort on cathode development. The performance and durability of the gas diffusion electrode is very much dependent on the way in which the layer structures are fabricated from carbon and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The choice and treatment of the carbon support is of prime importance for the final catalytic activity. Noble metal and non-noble metal catalysts have been investigated and show good performance, however, more work is still needed on cathode durability to ensure the long term success of the alkaline fuel cell. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{OttakamThotiyl2013,
abstract = {Carbon has been used widely as the basis of porous cathodes for nonaqueous Li-O(2) cells. However, the stability of carbon and the effect of carbon on electrolyte decomposition in such cells are complex and depend on the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the carbon surface. Analyzing carbon cathodes, cycled in Li-O(2) cells between 2 and 4 V, using acid treatment and Fenton's reagent, and combined with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and FTIR, demonstrates the following: Carbon is relatively stable below 3.5 V (vs Li/Li(+)) on discharge or charge, especially so for hydrophobic carbon, but is unstable on charging above 3.5 V (in the presence of Li(2)O(2)), oxidatively decomposing to form Li(2)CO(3). Direct chemical reaction with Li(2)O(2) accounts for only a small proportion of the total carbon decomposition on cycling. Carbon promotes electrolyte decomposition during discharge and charge in a Li-O(2) cell, giving rise to Li(2)CO(3) and Li carboxylates (DMSO and tetraglyme electrolytes). The Li(2)CO(3) and Li carboxylates present at the end of discharge and those that form on charge result in polarization on the subsequent charge. Li(2)CO(3) (derived from carbon and from the electrolyte) as well as the Li carboxylates (derived from the electrolyte) decompose and form on charging. Oxidation of Li(2)CO(3) on charging to {\^{a}}ˆ¼4 V is incomplete; Li(2)CO(3) accumulates on cycling resulting in electrode passivation and capacity fading. Hydrophilic carbon is less stable and more catalytically active toward electrolyte decomposition than carbon with a hydrophobic surface. If the Li-O(2) cell could be charged at or below 3.5 V, then carbon may be relatively stable, however, its ability to promote electrolyte decomposition, presenting problems for its use in a practical Li-O(2) battery. The results emphasize that stable cycling of Li(2)O(2) at the cathode in a Li-O(2) cell depends on the synergy between electrolyte and electrode; the stability of the electrode and the electrolyte cannot be considered in isolation.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that cyclic and linear carbonates, commonly used solvents in Li ion battery electrolytes, are unstable in the presence of superoxide and thus are not suitable for use in rechargeable Li-air batteries employing aprotic electrolytes. A detailed understanding of related decomposition mechanisms provides an important basis for the selection and design of stable electrolyte materials. In this article, we use density functional theory calculations with a Poisson-Boltzmann continuum solvent model to investigate the reactivity of several classes of aprotic solvents in nucleophilic substitution reactions with superoxide. We find that nucleophilic attack by O(2)([sup]-) at the O-alkyl carbon is a common mechanism of decomposition of organic carbonates, sulfonates, aliphatic carboxylic esters, lactones, phosphinates, phosphonates, phosphates, and sulfones. In contrast, nucleophilic reactions of O(2)([sup]-) with phenol esters of carboxylic acids and O-alkyl fluorinated aliphatic lactones proceed via attack at the carbonyl carbon. Chemical functionalities stable against nucleophilic substitution by superoxide include N-alkyl substituted amides, lactams, nitriles, and ethers. The results establish that solvent reactivity is strongly related to the basicity of the organic anion displaced in the reaction with superoxide. Theoretical calculations are complemented by cyclic voltammetry to study the electrochemical reversibility of the O(2)/O(2)([sup]-) couple containing tetrabutylammonium salt and GCMS measurements to monitor solvent stability in the presence of KO(2)([sup]) and a Li salt. These experimental methods provide efficient means for qualitatively screening solvent stability in Li-air batteries. A clear correlation between the computational and experimental results is established. The combination of theoretical and experimental techniques provides a powerful means for identifying and designing stable solvents for rechargeable Li-air batteries.},

abstract = {Understanding fundamental electrochemical characteristics of industrial
fluids, lubricants and their contaminants will allow for improvements

on the electrochemical characterization of model systems of colloidal
dispersions of carbon black (CB), validation of these models, and
investigation of applications of electrochemistry for determining
the relative effectiveness of dispersants. Utilizing electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of industrial colloidal dispersions,
an experimental method was developed to study the mechanism of dispersant/carbon
black interactions, and the role of these interactions in the formation
and stabilization of colloidal dispersions. Experimental EIS parameters
such as conductivity, permittivity, critical frequencies of impedance
and modulus relaxations, and impedance and modulus values were used
in modeling equations describing particle sizes and interaction mechanisms
occurring in CB dispersions. Results from the modeling equations
show that dispersant micelles averaging 9 nm in diameter were present
in solution. The dispersant micelles have a tendency to aggregate
and form a loose "network". In solutions containing CB, dispersants
surround CB particles and form a colloidal suspension. An increase
in relative concentration of the dispersant leads to a better stability
of the suspension and prevents CB agglomeration. The diameter of
the suspended CB particles decreases with added dispersant until
a stabilization point is reached at approximately 200 nm. The validity
of the impedance data and results of the modeling equations were
confirmed by other analytical techniques, such as quasi-elastic light
scattering and adsorption analysis. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

abstract = {Trends in electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are investigated on the basis of a large database of HO* and HOO* adsorption energies on oxide surfaces. The theoretical overpotential was calculated by applying standard density functional theory in combination with the computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) model. We showed that by the discovery of a universal scaling relation between the adsorption energies of HOO* vs HO*, it is possible to analyze the reaction free energy diagrams of all the oxides in a general way. This gave rise to an activity volcano that was the same for a wide variety of oxide catalyst materials and a universal descriptor for the oxygen evolution activity, which suggests a fundamental limitation on the maximum oxygen evolution activity of planar oxide catalysts.},

abstract = {We construct a model of ac impedance response to blocked linear diffusion
that has a sloped low frequency region in the impedance plot. The
approach is based on the transmission line analogy to linear diffusion,
and it is equivalent to solving Fick’s law with a boundary condition
that allows us to set an arbitrary impedance response at low frequencies.
We argue that roughness at the blocking interface gives rise to constant
phase element (CPE) response at low frequencies, and we give an impedance
model function that can fit data along the whole frequency range
when such a CPE is found. This is tested in an experiment of Li+
insertion in Nb2O5. The model should be of significance for metal
oxide thin film electrodes and modified polymer electrodes.},

For NP neither Butler?Volmer nor Marcus?Hush models are able to obtain very accurate fits to experiment, although it was possible for the Butler?Volmer model to yield more accurate fits if the transfer coefficients, $\alpha$ and ?, are not required to sum to unity, which is possibly justifiable due to the very large difference between oxidative and reductive peak potentials.

results were analysed in terms of the high frequency resistance,
the contribution of the charge transfer due to the oxygen reduction
reaction and a low frequency relaxation process. With respect to
the system, the results are analysed in terms of the membrane thickness
and history, the working temperature of the cell and the humidification
conditions of the reactant gases, and show clearly that thinner membranes
present better characteristics of water management, being much less

XPS is a versatile method to detect amorphous as well as crystalline decomposition products of both salts and solvents. Two strategies were employed. First, cathodes including carbon, $\alpha$-MnO2 catalyst, and Kynar binder (PVdF-HFP) were exposed to Li2O2 and LiClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) or tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) electrolytes. The results indicated that Li2O2 degrades TEGDME to carboxylate containing species and that the decomposition products, in turn, degraded the Kynar binder. The $\alpha$-MnO2 catalyst was unaffected. Second, Li2O2 model surfaces were kept in contact with different electrolytes to investigate the chemical stability and also the resulting surface layer on Li2O2. Further, the XPS experiments revealed that the Li salts such as LiPF6, LiBF4, and LiClO4 decomposed to form LiF or LiCl together with P?O or B?O bond containing compounds when exposed to Li2O2. PC decomposed to carbonate and ether based species. The degradation of the electrolytes increased from short to long exposure time indicating that the surface layer on Li2O2 became thicker by increasing time. Overall, it was shown that a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) is more robust in contact with Li2O2 compared to PC.

Here we present ruthenium oxide nanoparticles (RuO2 NPs) dispersed on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a cathode, which dramatically increase the electrical efficiency up to 73{\%}. We demonstrate that the RuO2 NPs contribute to the formation of poorly crystalline lithium peroxide (Li2O2) that is coated over the CNT with large contact area during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This unique Li2O2 structure can be smoothly decomposed at low potential upon oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by avoiding the energy loss associated with the decomposition of the more typical Li2O2 structure with a large size, small CNT contact area, and insulating crystals.},

abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been used to determine several electrochemical properties of the anode and cathode of a mediator-less microbial fuel cell (MFC) under different operational conditions. These operational conditions included a system with and without the bacterial catalyst and EIS measurements at the open-circuit potential of the anode and the cathode or at an applied cell voltage. In all cases the impedance spectra followed a simple one-time-constant model (OTCM) in which the solution resistance is in series with a parallel combination of the polarization resistance and the electrode capacitance. Analysis of the impedance spectra showed that addition of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to a solution of buffer and lactate greatly increased the rate of the lactate oxidation at the anode under open-circuit conditions. The large decrease of open-circuit potential of the anode increased the cell voltage of the MFC and its power output. Measurements of impedance spectra for the MFC at different cell voltages resulted in determining the internal resistance (Rint) of the MFC and it was found that Rint is a function of cell voltage. Additionally, Rint was equal to Rext at the cell voltage corresponding to maximum power, where Rext is the external resistance that must be applied across the circuit to obtain the maximum power output. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we systematically investigate the mechanisms of the ORR/OER reactions in nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, using 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide as a spin trap. The study provides direct verification of the formation of the superoxide radical anion (O2 (.-) ) as an intermediate in the ORR during the discharge process, while no O2 (.-) was detected in the OER during the charge process. These findings provide insight into, and an understanding of, the fundamental reaction mechanisms involving oxygen and guide the further development of this field.},

@article{Bazant2013,
abstract = {Advances in the fields of catalysis and electrochemical energy conversion often involve nanoparticles, which can have kinetics surprisingly different from the bulk material. Classical theories of chemical kinetics assume independent reactions in dilute solutions, whose rates are determined by mean concentrations. In condensed matter, strong interactions alter chemical activities and create variations that can dramatically affect the reaction rate. The extreme case is that of a reaction coupled to a phase transformation, whose kinetics must depend not only on the order parameter but also on its gradients at phase boundaries. Reaction-driven phase transformations are common in electrochemistry, when charge transfer is accompanied by ion intercalation or deposition in a solid phase. Examples abound in Li-ion, metal-air, and lead-acid batteries, as well as metal electrodeposition-dissolution. Despite complex thermodynamics, however, the standard kinetic model is the Butler-Volmer equation, based on a dilute solution approximation. The Marcus theory of charge transfer likewise considers isolated reactants and neglects elastic stress, configurational entropy, and other nonidealities in condensed phases. The limitations of existing theories recently became apparent for the Li-ion battery material LixFePO4 (LFP). It has a strong tendency to separate into Li-rich and Li-poor solid phases, which scientists believe limits its performance. Chemists first modeled phase separation in LFP as an isotropic "shrinking core" within each particle, but experiments later revealed striped phase boundaries on the active crystal facet. This raised the question: What is the reaction rate at a surface undergoing a phase transformation? Meanwhile, dramatic rate enhancement was attained with LFP nanoparticles, and classical battery models could not predict the roles of phase separation and surface modification. In this Account, I present a general theory of chemical kinetics, developed over the past 7 years, which is capable of answering these questions. The reaction rate is a nonlinear function of the thermodynamic driving force, the free energy of reaction, expressed in terms of variational chemical potentials. The theory unifies and extends the Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations through a master equation for nonequilibrium chemical thermodynamics. For electrochemistry, I have also generalized both Marcus and Butler-Volmer kinetics for concentrated solutions and ionic solids. This new theory provides a quantitative description of LFP phase behavior. Concentration gradients and elastic coherency strain enhance the intercalation rate. At low currents, the charge-transfer rate is focused on exposed phase boundaries, which propagate as "intercalation waves", nucleated by surface wetting. Unexpectedly, homogeneous reactions are favored above a critical current and below a critical size, which helps to explain the rate capability of LFP nanoparticles. Contrary to other mechanisms, elevated temperatures and currents may enhance battery performance and lifetime by suppressing phase separation. The theory has also been extended to porous electrodes and could be used for battery engineering with multiphase active materials. More broadly, the theory describes nonequilibrium chemical systems at mesoscopic length and time scales, beyond the reach of molecular simulations and bulk continuum models. The reaction rate is consistently defined for inhomogeneous, nonequilibrium states, for example, with phase separation, large electric fields, or mechanical stresses. This research is also potentially applicable to fluid extraction from nanoporous solids, pattern formation in electrophoretic deposition, and electrochemical dynamics in biological cells.},

The results indicated that the reaction mechanism of MnO2 electrode in LiOH electrolyte appears to be Li+ ion insertion/extraction in MnO2 solid, which is different with that electrode in KOH electrolyte. Charge/discharge experiments showed that the rate dischargeability of the MnO2/AC capacitor with 1 M LiOH electrolyte is excellent, and the cyclic stability of the MnO2/AC capacitor with 1 M LiOH electrolyte is much better than that with 1 M KOH electrolyte. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here we describe a method for determining separately the in-plane (x, y-directions) and through-plane (z-direction), viscous and inertial permeability coefficients of macro-porous substrates and micro-porous layers by controlling the direction of the gas flow through the porous sample. The method is applied initially to the macro-porous substrate of the GDL alone and subsequently to the macro-porous substrate with different micro-porous layers applied on it. The permeability coefficients of the micro-porous layer are calculated from the two measurements. The permeability coefficients are calculated from the Darcy–Forchheimer equation by application of the method of least squares. The method was applied to GDLs having different contents of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon types. The samples with a higher PTFE content have in-plane and through-plane viscous permeability coefficients higher than those of the samples with lower PTFE content. The in-plane and through-plane viscous permeability coefficients also depend on the carbon type.},

@article{Park2004,
abstract = {The behavior of water in the gas diffusion layers of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was investigated analytically. To understand the water transportation phenomena systematically, the gas diffusion layers were divided into two parts. One is the gas diffusion medium (GDM) and the other is micro-layer (ML). In this work, the GDM with different PTFE contents was intensively investigated under various single cell operation conditions. I–V performance curves of single cells were compared and analyzed with respect to water transportation in the GDM. The increased PTFE contents disturb the ejection of liquid-phase water from the electrodes to the flow channels via the GDM, especially at higher relative humidity conditions. I–V performance curves in this work can also be interpreted as an evidence that capillary force in the GDM is not the main driving force for the water transportation. Other forces, for example shear force of fluid and water evaporation etc. are more dominant driving forces, at least with in the GDM itself. This is because of the relatively larger pore diameter of the GDM compared to that of electrodes and ML. When a ML was used in the GDM, the I–V performance of fuel cell became more stabilized as well as enhanced. In regard to water management, the ML might have important roles as buffer zone which prevent serious drying and flooding of the electrode. So, when the entire gas diffusion part is designed, the capillary-force-driven water movement and the shear-force- or vaporization-driven water transportation should be considered carefully for both the ML and the GDM structures.},

In this study, the catalyst electrode, where discharge products are deposited and decomposed, was investigated as it has a critical role in the operation of rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries. Here we report the electrode design principle to improve specific capacity and cycling performance of lithium-oxygen batteries by utilizing high-efficiency nanocatalysts assembled by M13 virus with earth-abundant elements such as manganese oxides.

Different organic polymers have been used to fabricate graphene filled polymer nanocomposites by a range of methods. In the case of modified graphene-based polymer nanocomposites, the percolation threshold can be achieved at a very lower filler loading.

studied for atomically flat and nanoporous conductive electrodes

the electrolyte was observed to form a multilayer structure near
the electrode described by exponentially decaying sinusoidal oscillations
in ion and charge densities perpendicular to the electrode/electrolyte

was found to exhibit "U-shaped" behavior while the EDL capacitance
exhibited complex dependence on electrode potential including regions
of negative capacitance near zero electrode potential. Increased
capacitance and an enhanced degree of electrode-electrolyte interface
structure were observed with decreasing temperature. For nanoporous
electrodes with both slit and cylindrical pore geometries, the electrolyte
was observed to form highly structured alternating charged layers
within the electrode nanopores. A maximum in the normalized (per
unit electrode area) EDL capacitance was found for pore widths that
accommodate several charged layers inside the pores. The observed
dependence of capacitance on pore size appears to be a compromise
between increasing structure/charge imbalance and decreasing ion
density with decreasing pore width/diameter.},

In air-saturated 0.1 molar potassium hydroxide, we observed a steady-state output potential of -80 millivolts and a current density of 4.1 milliamps per square centimeter at -0.22 volts, compared with -85 millivolts and 1.1 milliamps per square centimeter at -0.20 volts for a platinum-carbon electrode. The incorporation of electron-accepting nitrogen atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane appears to impart a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms. This effect, coupled with aligning the NCNTs, provides a four-electron pathway for the ORR on VA-NCNTs with a superb performance.},

theory of partial diffusion-limited interfacial transfer/reaction

as a random surface fractal, which is characterized by statistically
isotropic self-affine fractals on limited length scales. The power
spectrum of roughness of such surface fractal is approximated in
terms of power law function for the intermediate wave-numbers (or
spatial frequency components in roughness). This description of roughness
consists of four fractal morphological characteristic features. Results
unravel the connection between the flux/current, surface morphology
and its kinetics following a step of surface activity (like a potential
step experiment). We show the dependence of reaction flux/current
on various fractal roughness characteristics related to power spectrum,
and discuss the dynamic crossover of charge transfer controlled regime
to fractal morphology controlled diffusion regime to classical inverse
square root of time regime. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {General considerations in nonlinear least squares fitting of small-signal ac frequency response data (conductive or dielectric systems) are first discussed. A very general and flexible complex nonlinear least squares fitting (CNLS) program (LOMFP) is described which runs on microcomputers of the PC and AT type. Advantages and disadvantages of LOMFP are discussed and compared to those of a recent CNLS program developed by Boukamp. LOMFP incorporates many thousands of equivalent circuits fitting possibilities and ten different distributed circuit elements which can be used in these circuits. Its fitting is both speedy and accurate, and it provides considerable insurance against confusing local minima fits with true least squares fits. It is optimized for fitting real, imaginary, or complex data of either partly conducting or purely dielectric character, and it incorporates great flexibility in handling and fitting data in different forms (different immittance levels and rectangular or polar representation). Seven different data weighting choices are provided. Exact synthetic data were generated from a typical Impedance Spectroscopy equivalent circuit, and the effects on CNLS fitting were investigated of rounding the exact data to 4, 3, and 2 decimal places. We present the results of an extensive study of the effects of transforming exact data to different immittance levels and representations and then rounding to two places or of transforming rounded 2-place data directly. We conclude that real data should not be transformed from its original measured form before carrying out CNLS fitting. Finally, the effects were investigated of various kinds of weightings on CNLS fitting of 2-place data, leading to the conclusion that in spite of its advocacy and use by Zoltowski and Boukamp, modulus weighting generally yields misleading and appreciably worse CNLS fitting results than does proportional weighting. The LOMFP program (source and executable files) is available from the first author.},

In addition, it is shown that the impedance of the air cathode-electrolyte interface is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the anode. Equivalent circuit fitting parameters indicate the difference in the anode-electrolyte interface characteristics for different types of silicon wafers. Evolution of porous silicon surfaces at the anode and their properties, by means of estimated circuit parameters, is also presented. Moreover, it is found that the silicon anode potential has the highest negative impact on the battery discharge voltage, while the air cathode potential is actually stable and invariable along the whole discharge period.

abstract = {Developing rechargeable Li-O2 batteries hinges on identifying stable solvents resistant to decomposition. Here, we focus on solvent stability against adsorption-induced H-abstraction during discharge. Using a detailed thermodynamic analysis, we show that a solvent?s propensity to resist H-abstraction is determined by its acid dissociation constant, pKa, in its own environment. Upon surveying hundreds of solvents for their pKa values in different media, we find linear correlations between the pKa values across various classes of solvents in any two given media. Utilizing these correlations, we choose DMSO as the common standard to compare the relative stability trends. We construct a stability plot based on the solvent?s HOMO level and its pKa in DMSO, which reveals that most solvents obey a correlation where solvents with lower HOMO levels tend to have lower pKa values in DMSO. However, this is at odds with the stability requirement that demands deep HOMO levels and high pKa values. Thus, stable solvents need to be outliers to this observed correlation.

@article{Huang2010,
abstract = {A three-dimensional, two-phase, non-isothermal model has been developed to explore the interaction between heat and water transport in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Water condensate produced from the electrochemical reaction may accumulate in the open pores of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and retard the oxygen transport to the catalyst sites. This study predicts the enhancement of the water transport for linear porosity gradient in the cathode GDL of a PEMFC. An optimal porosity distribution was found based on a parametric study. Results show that a optimal linear porosity gradient with ɛ1 = 0.7 and ɛ2 = 0.3 for the parallel and z-serpentine channel design leads to a maximum increase in the limiting current density from 10,696 Am−2 to 13,136 Am−2 and 14,053 Am−2 to 16,616 Am−2 at 0.49 V, respectively. On the other hand, the oxygen usage also increases from 36{\%} to 46{\%} for the parallel channel design and from 55{\%} to 67{\%} for the z-serpentine channel design. The formation of a porosity gradient in the GDL enhances the capillary diffusivity, increases the electrical conductivity, and hence, benefits the oxygen transport throughout the GDL. The present study provides a theoretical support for existing reports that a GDL with a gradient porosity improves cell performance.},

It was found that extensive work has been carried out on the issues of flooding during the last two decades, including prediction through numerical modeling, detection by experimental measurements, and mitigation through the design of cell components and manipulating the operating conditions. Two classes of strategies to mitigate flooding have been developed. The first is based on system design and engineering, which is often accompanied by significant parasitic power loss. The second class is based on membrane electrode assembly (MEA) design and engineering, and involves modifying the material and structural properties of the gas diffusion layer (GDL), cathode catalyst layer (CCL) and membrane to function in the presence of liquid water. In this review, several insightful directions are also suggested for future investigation.},

two parallel FSW elements with different diffusion time constants,
were proposed to describe the most important specific features of
potentiostatic intermittent titration (PITT) and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) responses of practical intercalation
anodes and cathodes. Based on the physical reliability of the fitting
parameters, the parallel diffusion path model was seen to describe
adequately the EIS and PITT responses obtained from thin, non-uniform
composite electrodes (graphite is considered as an example). Some
important issues related to impedance modeling (exemplified by comparison
of the properties of serial and parallel combinations of distributed
diffusion elements) are discussed. We show that dlog|Id(t)|/dlog
t vs. t/??d plots are very useful for diagnosing the type of non-uniformity
(particle size distribution, PSD) of intercalation electrodes. ??

abstract = {The wetting of microstructured surfaces is studied both experimentally
and theoretically. Even relatively simple surface topographies such
as grooves with rectangular cross section exhibit a large variety
of different wetting morphologies as observed by atomic force microscopy.
This polymorphism arises from liquid wedge formation along the groove
corners and from contact line pinning along the groove edges. A global
morphology diagram is derived that depends only on two system parameters:
(i) the aspect ratio of the groove geometry and (ii) The contact
angle of the underlying substrate material. For microfluidics, the
most interesting shape regimes involve extended liquid filaments,
which can grow and shrink in length while their cross section stays
essentially constant. Thus, any method by which one can vary the
contact angle can be used to switch the length of the filament, as
is demonstrated in the context of electrowetting.},

abstract = {Quantifying the promise of lithium–air batteries for electric vehicles† Kevin G. Gallagher,*ab Steven Goebel,‡ac Thomas Greszler,§ac Mark Mathias,ac Wolfgang Oelerich,{\{} ad Damla Erogluab and Venkat Srinivasanae Researchers worldwide view the high theoretical specific energy of the lithium–air or lithium–oxygen battery as a promising path to a transformational energy-storage system for electric vehicles. Here, we present a self-consistent material-to-system analysis of the best-case mass, volume, and cost values for the nonaqueous lithium–oxygen battery and compare them with current and advanced lithium-based batteries using metal-oxide positive electrodes. Surprisingly, despite their high theoretical specific energy, lithium–oxygen systems were projected to achieve parity with other candidate chemistries as a result of the requirement to deliver and purify or to enclose the gaseous oxygen reactant. The theoretical specific energy, which leads to predictions of an order of magnitude improvement over a traditional lithium-ion battery, is shown to be an inadequate predictor of systems-level cost, volume, and mass. This analysis reveals the importance of system-level considerations and identifies the reversible lithium-metal negative electrode as a common, critical high-risk technology needed for batteries to reach long-term automotive objectives.

abstract = {A well-known Scharfetter-Gummel (SG) scheme for convection-dominated problems of semiconductor and gas discharge plasmas is improved. A one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation is considered. It is shown that the original SG scheme is accurate if the potential drop between two adjacent nodes is much less than the electron temperature. To satisfy this condition a pair of additional nodes between adjacent nodes are inserted. The distance between these "virtual" nodes can be choosen small enough to obtain flux at the cell bound with the high accuracy. The number densities at virtual nodes are found by interpolation. Tests have shown that the accuracy of this scheme is comparable to the FCT technique, but in contrast it does not produce a "staircase" disturbance on rapidly changing functions.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the small signal ac impedance of electron diffusion and recombination in a spatially restricted situation with application in systems such as porous TiO2 nanostructured photoelectrodes and intrinsically conducting polymers. It is shown that the diffusion?recombination model with the main types of boundary conditions assumes a finite set of possible behaviors in the frequency domain, which are classified according to relevant physical parameters. There are four possible cases:? (i) the impedance of finite diffusion with reflecting boundary, (ii) the impedance of finite diffusion with absorbing boundary, (iii) the impedance of diffusion-reaction in semiinfinite space or Gerischer impedance, and (iv) the impedance that combines Warburg response at high frequency and a reaction arc at low frequency. The generality of the approach is discussed in terms of the spatial distribution of the electrochemical potential or quasi-Fermi level and also in terms of the transmission line representation. An extension is considered to the diffusion in lithium intercalation electrodes coupled to a homogeneous solid-state reaction. The connection is established with other frameworks for the description of transport and reaction in electrochemical systems.

@article{Sridhar2001,
abstract = {Two methods of humidifying the anode gas, namely, external and membrane humidification, for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel (PEMFC) cell are explained. It is found that the water of solvation of protons decreases with increase in the current density and the electrode area. This is due to insufficient external humidification. In a membrane-based humidification, an optimum set of parameters, such as gas flow rate, area and type of the membrane, must be chosen to achieve effective humidification. The present study examines the dependence of water pick-up by hydrogen on the temperature, area and thickness of the membrane in membrane humidification. Since the performance of the fuel cell is dependent more on hydrogen humidification than on oxygen humidification, the scope of the work is restricted to the humidification of hydrogen using Nafion® membrane. An examination is made on the dependence of water pick-up by hydrogen in membrane humidification on the temperature, area and thickness of the membrane. The dependence of fuel cell performance on membrane humidification and external humidification in the anode gas is also considered.},
