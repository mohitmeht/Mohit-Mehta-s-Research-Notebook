  Abstract                 = {This article investigates the effects of discrete dopant location and concentration on the differential capacitance of nanoscale metallic probes situated on the surface of semiconductor materials. Using the formalism of doping sensitivity functions, it is shown that the differential capacitance of such systems is particularly sensitive to the exact location and concentration of dopant atoms, which can potentially lead to the development of new techniques for atomistic 3-D dopant profiling. Such techniques require solving the inverse problem, in which we compute the 3-D dopant profile from the output capacitance-voltage characteristics of the system. This problem is mathematically challenging, but can be solved in principle using the formalism of doping sensitivity functions. In the final part of the presentation we present a number of sample simulations and analyze the challenges of this approach.},

Electrolyte concentrations were varied to near saturation and temperatures were set at 10, 20, and 40 OC. The results were correlated on the basis of the Eyring theory of rate processes. The free energy of activation of oxygen in a solution is assumed to consist of the sum of contributions due to various chemical species in the solution. The variations of the free energy with temperature for different diffusing solutes are discussed. With the results of this work, prediction of the diffusivities of gases in aqueous electrolyte solutions is possible, if gas diffusivities in pure water and the densities of the solutions are available.},

A theoretical model is developed which includes mass transfer, ohmic, kinetic, and geometric parameters. The model succeeds in predicting limiting current behavior over a wide range of operating conditions. A simple algebraic criterion is suggested for estimating the limiting current and collection effectiveness of flow-through porous electrodes.},

Tafel data for several of the catalysts are used to predict potential-dependent activation energies for oxygen reduction over the 0.6-0.9 V range in strong and weak acid. Comparisons with the theoretical curve show good agreement above 0.8 V, suggesting a fairly constant preexponential factor. Arrhenius determinations of activation energies over the 0.7-0.9 V range yield little trend for weak acid, possibly because of the larger uncertainties in the Arrhenius fits, but the strong acid results have smaller uncertainties and for them the measured activation energies trend up with potential.},

EIS supplied information on the polarization resistance and CV on the electrochemical active area for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These parameters, together with those derived from GP, allowed a better identification of the features governing the ORR. An optimum Nafion loading was identified. This loading was found to correspond to a minimum in the polarization resistance and in the oxygen reduction overpotential and a maximum in the electrochemical active area.},

  abstract = {The activity and stability of bifunctional air electrodes for electrically rechargeable metal air batteries were investigated using ac impedance spectroscopy. The poly(tetrafluoroethylene) bonded electrodes consisted of a perovskite{\^{a}}{\texteuro}�type catalyst dispersed on high surface area carbon (Ketjen black) or on graphitized carbon (Vulcan XC 72). The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit contaning two finite diffusion terms. The diffusing species were shown to be oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte solution and the peroxide ion generated at the electrode by the electrochemical reaction. The electrode deterioration occurring during anodic oxygen evolution was also studied using impedance analysis. The degradation, mainly carbon corrosion, resulted in a loss of electrochemically active surface area of the electrode. High catalyst loadings improved the electrode stability. The electrode characteristics are discussed using the electrochemical parameters obtained from the impedance spectra analysis. {\^{A}}{\copyright} 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

  abstract  = {This work reports computed rate coefficients of 90 reactions important in the autocatalytic oxidation of hydroxylamine in aqueous nitric acid. Rate coefficients were calculated using four approaches: Smoluchowski (Stokes-Einstein) diffusion, a solution-phase incarnation of transition state theory based on quantum chemistry calculations, simple Marcus theory for electron-transfer reactions, and a variational TST approach for dissociative isomerization reactions that occur in the solvent cage. Available experimental data were used to test the accuracy of the computations. There were significant discrepancies between the computed and experimental values for some key parameters, indicating a need for improvements in computational methodology. Nonetheless, the 90-reaction mechanism showed the ability to reproduce many of the trends seen in experimental studies of this very complicated kinetic system. This work highlights reactions that may govern the system evolution and branching behavior critical to the stability of the system. We hope that this analysis will guide experimental investigations to reduce the uncertainties in the critical rate coefficients and thermochemistry, allowing an unambiguous determination of the dominant reaction pathways in the system. Advances in efficient and accurate solvation models that effectively separate entropic and enthalpic contributions will most directly benefit solution-phase modeling efforts. Methods for more accurately estimating activity coefficients, including at infinite dilution in multicomponent mixtures, are needed for modeling high ionic strength aqueous systems. A detailed derivation of the solution-phase equilibrium and transition state theory rate expressions in solution is included in the Supporting Information.},

Various combinations of cells were built and tested with PTLs at the electrodes using either carbon fibre paper with a MPL (SGL 10BB) or carbon fibre paper without a MPL (SGL 10BA). The net water drag coefficient at three current densities (0.3, 0.5 and 0.7Acm$-$2) for two combinations of anode/cathode relative humidity (60/100\% and 100/60\%) and stoichiometric ratios of H2/air (1.4/3 and 1.4/2) was determined from water balance measurements. The addition of a MPL to the carbon fibre paper PTL at the cathode did not cause a statistically significant change to the overall drag coefficient although there was a significant improvement to the fuel cell performance and durability when a MPL was used at the cathode. The presence of a MPL on either electrode or on both electrodes also exhibited similar performance compared to when the MPL was placed at the cathode. These results indicate that the presence of MPL indeed improves the cell performance although it does not affect the net water drag coefficient. The correlation between cell performance and global water transport cannot be ascertained and warrants further experimental investigation.},

The main point of interest is the correlation among electrochemical kinetics, impedance, surface chemistry, 3D structure, and morphology of these systems, studied by the use of electroanalytical tools in conjunction with XRD, microscopy and spectroscopy. Magnesium insertion into Chevrel phases and Li insertion into most of the electrodes relevant to Li batteries involves phase transition. Thereby, the electrodes' kinetics are affected by interfacial charge transfer processes, solid-state diffusion, and the moving of boundaries between phases. The electrochemical response of the electrodes reflects all these processes. However, the identification of the relevant time constants that affect the measured electrochemical behavior is not trivial. Efforts are made in this paper to provide comprehensive guidelines regarding the proper use of fine electrochemical tools for the study of various types of insertion electrodes. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The correlation between the electrochemical properties, surface chemistry and morphology of Li electrodes in the above systems was studied using impedance spectroscopy, surface sensitive in situ and ex situ FTIR, X-ray microanalysis, electron microscopy and standard experiments of charge discharge cycling. It was found that all the salt anions explored have strong effects on all the above aspects, eg they strongly affect Li surface chemistry in solutions and participate in the build-up of surface films. The electrical properties of the Li-solution interphase formed in the different salt solutions are remarkably dependent on the salt anion. Consequently, the morphology and Li utility in repeated charge-discharge cycling are also strongly influenced by the salt used. Except for the Li halides, all the salts studied seem to be more reactive to lithium than LiClO4 and LiAsF6. They are worse than the commonly used LiAsF6 for rechargeable Li battery systems because their strong involvement in the Li surface chemistry adversely affects Li cycling efficiency.},

Our research demonstrates by combining electrochemical and analytical techniques that the performances of Li--O2 batteries based on LiTFSI-Tetraglyme electrolyte and Au-coated carbon electrodes are manly hindered by the instability of the lithium metal anode in the oxygen-saturated environment. Although the Au-coated carbon electrodes are able to minimize side reactions arising from electrolyte decomposition, oxygen crossover on the lithium metal results in the formation of decomposition products (LiOH, Li2CO3) that are clearly detrimental for the battery performance. Finally it is demonstrated that the Au-coated carbon electrodes in combination with the LiTFSI-Tetraglyme electrolyte can sustain extended cycling (100 cycles) when a more stable source of Li-ion, namely lithium iron phosphate (LFP), is used.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the oldest electroanalytical techniques. With respect to the investigation of the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, it has gained wide popularity as a non-destructive, sensitive and highly informative method. A particularly attractive advantage is that it provides a unique opportunity to distinguish contributions from different processes which take place simultaneously at the electrode surface. During the past decade, considerable progress has been made in the field of impedance spectroscopy to advance data acquisition, modelling and spectra analysis. EIS has evolved from slow data acquisition procedures with semi-quantitative interpretation to innovative methodologies which allow simple operation and accurate analysis using hundreds or even thousands of spectra; these spectra can often be recorded as a result of a single experiment. Impedance spectroscopy is nowadays widely combined with other techniques, with successful application in areas ranging from analytical and physical chemistry to localized impedance microscopies. The focus of this review is on recent experimental and theoretical achievements in the characterisation of the interfaces between metal electrodes and aqueous electrolytes using EIS. Some key challenges to further increase the informative power of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are also outlined.},

They include the capacitance of the electric double layer, the resistance of the interfacial charge transfer, capacitances of adsorption, or other parameters depending on the properties of the system. Additionally, the proposed approach eliminates many common methodological problems of localized electrochemical impedance microscopies related to the frequency dependence of the actual pictures and difficulties with raw data interpretation. Thus, it offers a unique insight into the localized processes at the interface which is not possible to achieve using classical techniques.},

  abstract  = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are of great interest to the automotive industry due to their higher power and energy density, higher cell voltage, longer cycle life and lower self-discharge compared to other battery chemistries. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a powerful tool employed to investigate the fundamental electrochemical reactions within a Li-ion battery cell, which relates to state of charge, internal temperature and state of health. Its effectiveness has established it as a core method to study electrochemical behaviour of batteries in both off-line and on-line applications. In this work it is shown that in addition to state of charge, internal temperature and state of health, the time period between the removal of an electrical load and the impedance measurement affects the results. The study of five commercially available cells of varying capacities and electrode chemistries show that, regardless of cell type, maximum impedance change takes place within the first 4{~}h of the relaxation period. The root cause of this impedance change has been discussed from an electrochemical perspective.},

However, for a \{SSA\} determined with the differential functional theory (DFT) model above a value of 1200&#xa0;m2/g the plot of Cg versus \{SDFT\} exhibits a plateau.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The behavior of three gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) with macro- and mesopores is investigated by in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the Li/O2 battery system while discharging. Using a three electrode setup the current response from the anode (Li metal) and cathode (GDE) can be separated and the changes of the electrochemical processes at the GDE during discharge can be observed, exclusively. We identify up to four processes with different time constants which we assign to the lithium ion migration through a surface layer, the charge-transfer from the carbon surface to the molecular oxygen, the lithium ion and oxygen diffusion towards the cathode surface and, in case of the mesoporous materials, the lithium ion movement inside the pores, along the pore axis. The latter finding reflects that pore clogging of such is a limiting factor for the discharge of the Li/O2 battery. A large mesopore volume as in the xerogel electrode, however, allows for a high storage capability and a long and constant oxygen reduction. We demonstrate that the three electrode EIS proves to be a powerful in situ diagnostic tool to determine the state and, hence, the reversibility of the reactions at the cathode.},

The reactors consisted of custom-modified SMA fiberoptic receptacles loaded with 150 $\mu$m silicon phthalocyanine glass sensitizer particles, where the particles were isolated from direct contact with water by a membrane adhesively bonded to the bottom of each device. A tube fed O(2) gas to the reactor chambers. In the presence of O(2), singlet oxygen was generated by illuminating the sensitizer particles with 669 nm light from an optical fiber coupled to the top of the reactor. The generated (1)O(2) was transported through the membrane by the O(2) stream and formed bubbles in solution. In solution, singlet oxygen reacted with probe compounds (9,10-anthracene dipropionate dianion, trans-2-methyl-2-pentanoate anion, N-benzoyl-D,L-methionine, or N-acetyl-D,L-methionine) to give oxidized products in two stages. The early stage was rapid and showed that (1)O(2) transfer occurred via bubbles mainly in the bulk water solution. The later stage was slow; it arose only from (1)O(2)-probe molecule contact at the gas/liquid interface. A mechanism is proposed that involves (1)O(2) mass transfer and solvation, where smaller bubbles provide better penetration of (1)O(2) into the flowing stream due to higher surface-to-volume contact between the probe molecules and (1)O(2).},

  abstract  = {The motivation for this review is the need to understand the interdependence of porous structure and reactivity of highly porous carbonaceous materials during oxidation. These materials can be oxidized in three regimes: regime I, kinetically controlled conditions; regime II, partial diffusion-controlled conditions; regime III, diffusion controlled conditions. Since the emphasis here is on the porous structure and its influence on reactivity, conditions where transport processes are dominant were not included for they mask the view of interest. Therefore, the review discusses only physicochemical processes occurring during oxidation of highly porous chars in regime I. Furthermore, reactivity is influenced by many factors, such as catalysis, volatile matter, and water content. To avoid the effect of these factors, highly porous synthetic chars with nothing but elemental carbon and residual hydrogen and oxygen was chosen. Mainly, we discuss a commercial product known as Spherocarb which consists of spherica l particles with specific surface area of about 1000 m2 g-1 and porosity of about 0.6. These particles are well defined and reproducible in their properties. They serve well as model materials for various synthetic chars, coal chars, and other carbonaceous materials. The review presents in a systematic manner macroscopic properties and processes that shed light on different aspects of porosity and reactivity. These are presented both from experimental observation as well as modeling view. An attempt was made to present a porous structure model that can reconstruct all available experimental data on these particles during oxidation. In the review the following processes and properties are discussed: shrinkage, fragmentation, and porosity. All are directly connected to porous structure and reactivity. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Furthermore, it has been studied how the electrochemical activation effect, i.e., the strong reduction of the surface exchange resistance after application of a large dc bias, depends on composition. � 2007 The Electrochemical Society},

  Abstract                 = {Advances in the fields of catalysis and electrochemical energy conversion often involve nanoparticles, which can have kinetics surprisingly different from the bulk material. Classical theories of chemical kinetics assume independent reactions in dilute solutions, whose rates are determined by mean concentrations. In condensed matter, strong interactions alter chemical activities and create variations that can dramatically affect the reaction rate. The extreme case is that of a reaction coupled to a phase transformation, whose kinetics must depend not only on the order parameter but also on its gradients at phase boundaries. Reaction-driven phase transformations are common in electrochemistry, when charge transfer is accompanied by ion intercalation or deposition in a solid phase. Examples abound in Li-ion, metal-air, and lead-acid batteries, as well as metal electrodeposition-dissolution. Despite complex thermodynamics, however, the standard kinetic model is the Butler-Volmer equation, based on a dilute solution approximation. The Marcus theory of charge transfer likewise considers isolated reactants and neglects elastic stress, configurational entropy, and other nonidealities in condensed phases. The limitations of existing theories recently became apparent for the Li-ion battery material LixFePO4 (LFP). It has a strong tendency to separate into Li-rich and Li-poor solid phases, which scientists believe limits its performance. Chemists first modeled phase separation in LFP as an isotropic "shrinking core" within each particle, but experiments later revealed striped phase boundaries on the active crystal facet. This raised the question: What is the reaction rate at a surface undergoing a phase transformation? Meanwhile, dramatic rate enhancement was attained with LFP nanoparticles, and classical battery models could not predict the roles of phase separation and surface modification. In this Account, I present a general theory of chemical kinetics, developed over the past 7 years, which is capable of answering these questions. The reaction rate is a nonlinear function of the thermodynamic driving force, the free energy of reaction, expressed in terms of variational chemical potentials. The theory unifies and extends the Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations through a master equation for nonequilibrium chemical thermodynamics. For electrochemistry, I have also generalized both Marcus and Butler-Volmer kinetics for concentrated solutions and ionic solids. This new theory provides a quantitative description of LFP phase behavior. Concentration gradients and elastic coherency strain enhance the intercalation rate. At low currents, the charge-transfer rate is focused on exposed phase boundaries, which propagate as "intercalation waves", nucleated by surface wetting. Unexpectedly, homogeneous reactions are favored above a critical current and below a critical size, which helps to explain the rate capability of LFP nanoparticles. Contrary to other mechanisms, elevated temperatures and currents may enhance battery performance and lifetime by suppressing phase separation. The theory has also been extended to porous electrodes and could be used for battery engineering with multiphase active materials. More broadly, the theory describes nonequilibrium chemical systems at mesoscopic length and time scales, beyond the reach of molecular simulations and bulk continuum models. The reaction rate is consistently defined for inhomogeneous, nonequilibrium states, for example, with phase separation, large electric fields, or mechanical stresses. This research is also potentially applicable to fluid extraction from nanoporous solids, pattern formation in electrophoretic deposition, and electrochemical dynamics in biological cells.},

  Abstract                 = {The venerable theory of electrokinetic phenomena rests on the hypothesis of a dilute solution of point-like ions in quasi-equilibrium with a weakly charged surface, whose potential relative to the bulk is of order the thermal voltage (kT/e approximately 25 mV at room temperature). In nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC or induced-charge electro-osmosis (ACEO, ICEO) and induced-charge electrophoresis (ICEP), several V approximately 100 kT/e are applied to polarizable surfaces in microscopic geometries, and the resulting electric fields and induced surface charges are large enough to violate the assumptions of the classical theory. In this article, we review the experimental and theoretical literatures, highlight discrepancies between theory and experiment, introduce possible modifications of the theory, and analyze their consequences. We argue that, in response to a large applied voltage, the "compact layer" and "shear plane" effectively advance into the liquid, due to the crowding of counterions. Using simple continuum models, we predict two general trends at large voltages: (i) ionic crowding against a blocking surface expands the diffuse double layer and thus decreases its differential capacitance, and (ii) a charge-induced viscosity increase near the surface reduces the electro-osmotic mobility; each trend is enhanced by dielectric saturation. The first effect is able to predict high-frequency flow reversal in ACEO pumps, while the second may explain the decay of ICEO flow with increasing salt concentration. Through several colloidal examples, such as ICEP of an uncharged metal sphere in an asymmetric electrolyte, we show that nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena are generally ion-specific. Similar theoretical issues arise in nanofluidics (due to confinement) and ionic liquids (due to the lack of solvent), so the paper concludes with a general framework of modified electrokinetic equations for finite-sized ions.},

These materials are investigated over a range of temperatures (303--343 K) and oxygen pressures (2--5 atm absolute), at 100\% relative humidity, using a solid-state electrochemical cell. Slow-sweep voltammetry yields exchange current density data, while chronoamperometry allows determination of the diffusion coefficient and solubility, for the different conditions specified. This information is used to calculate activation energies for the oxygen reduction process and for diffusion of oxygen in the membranes, as well as the enthalpies of dissolution. Nafion{\textregistered} 117 and the BAM{\textregistered} 407 membrane have similar permeabilities (Dbcb values), however, the diffusion coefficients and solubilities of oxygen are very different --- being related to the water content of the respective material.

To avoid flooding of the electrodes by the product water, the carbon paper is usually hydrophobed by partial coating with PTFE suspension. The influence of the PTFE coating and the following sintering time on through paper plane conductivity, gas permeability and paper hydrophobicity is analysed and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Rechargeable Li-air (henceforth referred to as Li-O2) batteries provide theoretical capacities that are ten times higher than that of current Li-ion batteries, which could enable the driving range of an electric vehicle to be comparable to that of gasoline vehicles. These high energy densities in Li-O2 batteries result from the atypical battery architecture which consists of an air (O2) cathode and a pure lithium metal anode. However, hurdles to their widespread use abound with issues at the cathode (relating to electrocatalysis and cathode decomposition), lithium metal anode (high reactivity towards moisture) and due to electrolyte decomposition. This review focuses on the key scientific challenges in the development of rechargeable non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries from both experimental and theoretical findings. This dual approach allows insight into future research directions to be provided and highlights the importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches in the optimization of Li-O2 battery systems.},

  abstract  = {This paper gives a technical background to alkaline fuel cells (AFCs), introducing the advantages and drawbacks of the technology. AFCs offer the potential for low cost, mass producible fuel cells, without the dependency on platinum based catalysts and (currently) expensive membrane electrolytes. The AFC uses relatively low cost electrolytes based on aqueous bases such as potassium hydroxide. The inherent CO2 sensitivity of the electrolyte can be addressed by filtering out the CO2 from the air intake using a simple scrubber and periodically replacing the liquid electrolyte. A review of the state-of-the-art in gas diffusion cathode development is given. The overall cell performance and stability is dominated by the behaviour of the cathode, leading to a focus of research effort on cathode development. The performance and durability of the gas diffusion electrode is very much dependent on the way in which the layer structures are fabricated from carbon and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The choice and treatment of the carbon support is of prime importance for the final catalytic activity. Noble metal and non-noble metal catalysts have been investigated and show good performance, however, more work is still needed on cathode durability to ensure the long term success of the alkaline fuel cell. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {We analyze the steady-state behavior of a general mathematical model for reversible galvanic cells, such as redox flow cells, reversible solid oxide fuel cells, and rechargeable batteries. We consider not only operation in the galvanic discharging mode, spontaneously generating a positive current against an external load, but also operation in two modes which require a net input of electrical energy: (i) the electrolytic charging mode, where a negative current is imposed to generate a voltage exceeding the open-circuit voltage, and (ii) the {\textquotedblleft}super-galvanic{\textquotedblright} discharging mode, where a positive current exceeding the short-circuit current is imposed to generate a negative voltage. Analysis of the various (dis-)charging modes of galvanic cells is important to predict the efficiency of electrical to chemical energy conversion and to provide sensitive tests for experimental validation of fuel cell models. In the model, we consider effects of diffuse charge on electrochemical charge-transfer rates by combining a generalized Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equation for reaction kinetics across the compact Stern layer with the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck transport theory, without assuming local electroneutrality. Since this approach is rare in the literature, we provide a brief historical review. To illustrate the general theory, we present results for a monovalent binary electrolyte, consisting of cations, which react at the electrodes, and non-reactive anions, which are either fixed in space (as in a solid electrolyte) or are mobile (as in a liquid electrolyte). The full model is solved numerically and compared to analytical results in the limit of thin diffuse layers, relative to the membrane thickness. The spatial profiles of the ion concentrations and electrostatic potential reveal a complex dependence on the kinetic parameters and the imposed current, in which the diffuse charge at each electrode and the total membrane charge can have either sign, contrary perhaps to intuition. For thin diffuse layers, simple analytical expressions are presented for galvanic cells valid in all three (dis-)charging modes in the two subsequent limits of the ratio $\delta$ of the effective thicknesses of the compact and diffuse layers: (i) the {\textquotedblleft}Helmholtz limit{\textquotedblright} ($\delta$$\rightarrow$$\infty$) where the compact layer carries the double layer voltage as in standard Butler-Volmer models, and (ii) the opposite {\textquotedblleft}Gouy-Chapman limit{\textquotedblright} ($\delta$$\rightarrow$0) where the diffuse layer fully determines the charge-transfer kinetics. In these limits, the model predicts both reaction-limited and diffusion-limited currents, which can be surpassed for finite positive values of the compact layer, diffuse layer and membrane thickness.},

  Abstract                 = {The recently developed modified Donnan (mD) model provides a simple and useful description of the electrical double layer in microporous carbon electrodes, suitable for incorporation in porous electrode theory. By postulating an attractive excess chemical potential for each ion in the micropores that is inversely proportional to the total ion concentration, we show that experimental data for capacitive deionization (CDI) can be accurately predicted over a wide range of applied voltages and salt concentrations. Since the ion spacing and Bjerrum length are each comparable to the micropore size (few nm), we postulate that the attraction results from fluctuating bare Coulomb interactions between individual ions and the metallic pore surfaces (image forces) that are not captured by meanfield theories, such as the Poisson-Boltzmann-Stern model or its mathematical limit for overlapping double layers, the Donnan model. Using reasonable estimates of the micropore permittivity and mean size (and no other fitting parameters), we propose a simple theory that predicts the attractive chemical potential inferred from experiments. As additional evidence for attractive forces, we present data for salt adsorption in uncharged microporous carbons, also predicted by the theory.},

We argue that roughness at the blocking interface gives rise to constant phase element (CPE) response at low frequencies, and we give an impedance model function that can fit data along the whole frequency range when such a CPE is found. This is tested in an experiment of Li+ insertion in Nb2O5. The model should be of significance for metal oxide thin film electrodes and modified polymer electrodes.},

The analytical model, fed with input parameters calculated by DFT, is shown to give symmetry factors in reasonable agreement with those of the full-scale DFT model.

  abstract = {Unraveling the fundamentals of Li-O(2) battery chemistry is crucial to develop practical cells with energy densities that could approach their high theoretical values. We report here a straightforward chemical approach that probes the outcome of the superoxide O(2)(-), thought to initiate the electrochemical processes in the cell. We show that this serves as a good measure of electrolyte and binder stability. Superoxide readily dehydrofluorinates polyvinylidene to give byproducts that react with catalysts to produce LiOH. The Li(2)O(2) product morphology is a function of these factors and can affect Li-O(2) cell performance. This methodology is widely applicable as a probe of other potential cell components.},

The impedimetric response was measured for different diameter AuNPs at a fixed value of their surface area, at the same content of gold (Au) and at the same concentration. In a further experiment, the impedimetric response toward AuNP concentration was measured for each diameter. Impedimetric results were compared with results obtained for the detection of Au by stripping voltammetry. Additionally, variability of active surface area and roughness of different electrodes before and after immobilization of AuNPs were carefully evaluated by means of cyclic voltammetry and laser scanning microscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a sensitive technique capable of differentiating the signal generated by AuNPs of different sizes, thus providing useful information for the employment of AuNPs in electrochemical biosensors.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the subtle effects of diffuse charge on interfacial kinetics by solving the governing equations for ion transport (Nernst-Planck) with realistic boundary conditions representing reaction kinetics (Butler-Volmer) and compact-layer capacitance (Stern) in the asymptotic limit \$\backslash epsilon = \backslash lambda\_D/L \backslash to 0\$, where \$\backslash lambda\_D\$ is the Debye screening length and \$L\$ is the distance between the working and counter electrodes. Using the methods of singular perturbation theory, we derive the leading-order steady-state response to a nonzero applied current in the case of the oxidation of a neutral species into cations, without any supporting electrolyte. In certain parameter regimes, the theory predicts a reaction-limited current smaller than the classical diffusion-limited current. We also analyze the impedance of the electrochemical cell when a small AC current modulation is added to an applied DC current. At sufficiently high AC frequencies, the Maxwell displacement current is found to exceed the Faradaic conduction current, and experimentally observed ``negative impedances'' (out of phase AC voltage responses) are predicted close to the reaction-limited current. Overall, we demonstrate that the dynamics of diffuse charge plays a fundamental role in nonequilibrium surface reactions when the transport of one of the reacting species is coupled to the total interfacial reponse of the compact and diffuse layers.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum chemistry studies of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) complexes with Li+ and LiPF6 have been conducted. We found that Li+ complexation significantly stabilizes the highly polar cis-trans DMC conformation relative to the nearly nonpolar gas-phase low energy cis-cis conformer. As a consequence, the binding of Li+ to EC in the gas phase is not as favorable relative to binding to DMC as previously reported. Furthermore, quantum chemistry studies reveal that, when complexation of LiPF6 ion pairs is considered, the DMC/LiPF6 complex is about 1 kcal/mol more stable than the EC/LiPF6 complex. The EC3DMC(cis-cis)/Li+ complex was found to be the most energetically stable among ECnDMCm/Li+ (n+m=4) investigated complexes followed by EC4/Li+. Results of the quantum chemistry studies of these complexes were utilized in the development of a many-body polarizable force field for EC:DMC/LiPF6 electrolytes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of EC/LiPF6, DMC/LiPF6, and mixed solvent EC:DMC/LiPF6 electrolytes utilizing this force field were performed at 1 M salt concentration for temperatures from 298 to 363 K. Good agreement was found between MD simulation predictions and experiments for thermodynamic and transport properties of both pure solvents and the electrolytes. We find increased ion pairing with increasing DMC content; however, both EC and DMC were found to participate in Li+ solvation in mixed EC:DMC electrolytes despite a huge difference in their dielectric constants. In contrast to previous NMR studies, where dominance of EC in cation solvation was reported, we find a slight preference for DMC in the cation solvation shell for EC:DMC (1 wt:1 wt) electrolytes and show that reanalyzed Raman spectroscopy experiments are in good agreement with results of MD simulations. Finally, analysis of solvent residence times reveals that cation transport is dominated by motion with solvating DMC and approximately equal contributions from vehicular motions with the first solvation shell and solvent exchange with respect to solvating EC.},

  abstract  = {A simple Fourier transform (FT) method is presented for obtaining a Distribution Function of Relaxation Times (DFRT) for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. By using a special data extension procedure the FT is performed over the range from -$\infty$$\leq$ln$\omega$$\leq$+$\infty$. The integration procedure is analytic in the end regions, otherwise a quadratic interpolation is used. For the necessary windowing of the first FT result, a special Tanh window function is used, which shows better results than the well-known Hann window function. An alternative approach, based on a complex nonlinear least squares (CNLS) fit of a linear sequence of (RQ){\textquoteright}s, provides the DFRT directly, but often significantly deviating from the FT-DFRT. With several examples the usefulness of a DFRT in impedance analysis is tested. The main conclusion is that the visibility in the DFRT of separate dispersive contributions strongly depends on the associated resistance and the width of the distribution. {\textquoteleft}Near equal strength{\textquoteright} dispersive contributions show up in the DFRT, where the area under the DFRT-peak represents the {\textquoteleft}strength{\textquoteright} or resistance. But small peaks with a large FWHM are lost, although these can easily be identified in a CNLS-fit. A comparison between the finite length Warburg (FLW) and the almost identical Gerischer impedance shows a clear difference in the DFRT. Indications are found that the characteristic Gerischer DFRT might be distinguishable in real measurement DFRT's. In cooperation with an external group a brief test with an adaptive genetic evolution method showed promising results for a direct definition of a DFRT. In this process the reconstructed impedance is matched to the actual measurement.},

  Abstract                 = {Matrix diffusion is an important transport process in geologic materials of low hydraulic conductivity. For predicting the fate and transport of contaminants, a detailed understanding of the diffusion processes in natural porous media is essential. In this study, diffusive tracer transport (iodide) was investigated in a variety of geologically different limestone and sandstone rocks. Porosity, structural and mineralogical composition, hydraulic conductivity, and other rock properties were determined. The effective diffusion coefficients were measured using the time-lag method. The results of the diffusion experiments indicate that there is a close relationship between total porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient of a rock (analogous to Archie's Law). Consequently, the tortousity factor can be expressed as a function of total porosity. The relationship fits best for thicker samples (> 1.0 cm) with high porosities (> 20\%), because of the reduced influence of heterogeneity in larger samples. In general, these correlations appear to be a simple way to determine tortuosity and the effective diffusion coefficient from easy to determine rock porosity values.},

However, the highest energy storage possible for Li-ion batteries is insufficient for the long-term needs of society, for example, extended-range electric vehicles. To go beyond the horizon of Li-ion batteries is a formidable challenge; there are few options. Here we consider two: Li-air (O(2)) and Li-S. The energy that can be stored in Li-air (based on aqueous or non-aqueous electrolytes) and Li-S cells is compared with Li-ion; the operation of the cells is discussed, as are the significant hurdles that will have to be overcome if such batteries are to succeed. Fundamental scientific advances in understanding the reactions occurring in the cells as well as new materials are key to overcoming these obstacles. The potential benefits of Li-air and Li-S justify the continued research effort that will be needed.},

Calculations suggest that propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, and dimethyl carbonate, commonly used electrolytes in Li-ion batteries, are easily decomposed by the superoxide ion via nucleophilic attack at the ethereal carbon atom. In the case of propylene carbonate, base-mediated proton abstraction from the methyl group has to be considered as an additional solvent decomposition pathway.

  Abstract                 = {There is increasing evidence that cyclic and linear carbonates, commonly used solvents in Li ion battery electrolytes, are unstable in the presence of superoxide and thus are not suitable for use in rechargeable Li-air batteries employing aprotic electrolytes. A detailed understanding of related decomposition mechanisms provides an important basis for the selection and design of stable electrolyte materials. In this article, we use density functional theory calculations with a Poisson-Boltzmann continuum solvent model to investigate the reactivity of several classes of aprotic solvents in nucleophilic substitution reactions with superoxide. We find that nucleophilic attack by O(2)([sup]-) at the O-alkyl carbon is a common mechanism of decomposition of organic carbonates, sulfonates, aliphatic carboxylic esters, lactones, phosphinates, phosphonates, phosphates, and sulfones. In contrast, nucleophilic reactions of O(2)([sup]-) with phenol esters of carboxylic acids and O-alkyl fluorinated aliphatic lactones proceed via attack at the carbonyl carbon. Chemical functionalities stable against nucleophilic substitution by superoxide include N-alkyl substituted amides, lactams, nitriles, and ethers. The results establish that solvent reactivity is strongly related to the basicity of the organic anion displaced in the reaction with superoxide. Theoretical calculations are complemented by cyclic voltammetry to study the electrochemical reversibility of the O(2)/O(2)([sup]-) couple containing tetrabutylammonium salt and GCMS measurements to monitor solvent stability in the presence of KO(2)([sup]) and a Li salt. These experimental methods provide efficient means for qualitatively screening solvent stability in Li-air batteries. A clear correlation between the computational and experimental results is established. The combination of theoretical and experimental techniques provides a powerful means for identifying and designing stable solvents for rechargeable Li-air batteries.},

Regarding the reactant transport, three transportation modes such as diffusion, migration, and convection are described. A focusing discussion is given to the reactant diffusion near the electrode surface using both Fick's first and second laws. In addition, based on the approach in literature, the kinetics of reactant transport near and within a porous matrix electrode layer and its effect on the electron-transfer process is also presented using a simple equivalent electrode/electrolyte interface.},

  Abstract                 = {The spherical agglomerate model represents the most detailed description of the PEM fuel cell catalyst layer as it accounts for both micro and macroscale transport phenomena. The usual approach with the classical spherical agglomerate model is to couple the homogenous mixture assumption for the agglomerate core to its idealized spherical geometry to obtain an analytical solution which is easily incorporated within a macroscale model. In this study, we incorporate numerical results from a modified agglomerate model based on discrete platinum particles [33] to create a more physically realistic 3D macroscale model for the PEM fuel cell cathode catalyst layer. Results from the 3D cathode model based on the modified particle approach are compared with the classical model and the macro-homogenous model. We find that, similar to the classical approach, the modified 3D model is able to reproduce previously reported trends for reactant, reaction rate, and overpotential distributions, whereas the macro-homogenous model fails to predict mass transport limitations properly. It is also shown that, unlike the classical approach, the modified 3D model is able to accurately predict the effect of Pt loading in the diffusion-loss region.},

All the previous studies regarding mass transport limitations were limited to pure GDLs, and experimental analysis of the impact of the MPL on the overall diffusion in the porous GDL is still lacking. A modified Loschmidt cell with an oxygen--nitrogen mixture is used in this work to determine the effect of MPL on the effective diffusion coefficients. It is found that Knudsen effects play a dominant role in the diffusion through the MPL where pore diameters are less than 1$\mu$m. Experimental results show that the effective diffusion coefficient of the MPL is only about 21\% that of its GDL substrate and Knudsen diffusion accounts for 80\% of the effective diffusion coefficient of the GDL with MPL measured in this study. No existing correlations can correlate the effective diffusion coefficient with significant Knudsen contribution.},

For this purpose, various forms of multisine EIS techniques were first developed via a noise signal synthesized by mixing ac waves of various frequencies, followed by fast Fourier transform of the signal and the resulting current. Subsequently, an entirely new concept was introduced in which true white noise was used as an excitation source, followed by Fourier transform of both excitation and response signals. Section 2 describes novel applications of the newly developed techniques to time-resolved impedance measurements as well as to impedance imaging. Section 3 is devoted to recent applications of EIS techniques, specifically traditional measurements in various fields with a special emphasis on biosensor detections.},

To maintain the MEA with a satisfactory water content and distribution, a novel gas diffusion layer (GDL) was designed by inserting a water management layer (WML) between the traditional GDL and the catalyst layer of the PEMFC. A simulator was developed for the optimization of the GDL, where the water distribution in the electrode and the profile of the water transport in the polymer membrane could be predicted. For this purpose, the water vapor permeability of the GDL, which was the main variable, was investigated under conditions similar to the PEMFC. Furthermore, the cell performance of the PEMFC with the GDL was tested. The testing results indicated that the water management in the MEA could be significantly improved by using the WML.},

  abstract  = {For a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), dry layer preparation was optimized and applied to fabricate a micro-porous layer (MPL) for a gas diffusion layer (GDL). The MPLs fabricated by dry layer preparation and the conventional wet layer preparation were compared by physical and electrochemical methods. The PEMFC using dry layer MPLs showed better performance than that using wet layer MPLs, especially when the cells were operated under conditions of high oxygen utilization rate and high humidification temperature of air. The mass transport properties of the GDLs with the dry layer MPLs were also better than with the wet layer MPLs, and were found to be related to the pore size distribution in GDLs. The differences in surface morphology and pore size distribution for the GDLs with the dry layer and wet layer MPLs were investigated and analyzed. The dry layer preparation for MPLs was found to be more beneficial for forming meso-pores (pore size in the range of 0.5--15$\mu$m), which are important and advantageous for facilitating gas transport in the GDLs. Moreover, the GDLs with the dry layer MPLs exhibited better electronic conductivity and more stable hydrophobicity than those with the wet layer MPLs. The reproducibility of the dry layer preparation for MPLs was also satisfying.},

Here, we investigate dimethylformamide as the basis of an electrolyte. Although reactions at the O(2) cathode on the first discharge-charge cycle are dominated by reversible Li(2)O(2) formation/decomposition, there is also electrolyte decomposition, which increases on cycling. The products of decomposition at the cathode on discharge are Li(2)O(2), Li(2)CO(3), HCO(2)Li, CH(3)CO(2)Li, NO, H(2)O, and CO(2). Li(2)CO(3) accumulates in the electrode with cycling. The stability of dimethylformamide toward reduced oxygen species is insufficient for its use in the rechargeable nonaqueous Li-O(2) battery.},

  Abstract                 = {The non-aqueous Li-air (O2) battery is receiving intense interest because its theoretical specific energy exceeds that of Li-ion batteries. Recharging the Li-O2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2), which is formed on discharge within the porous cathode. However, transporting charge between Li2O2 particles and the solid electrode surface is at best very difficult and leads to voltage polarization on charging, even at modest rates. This is a significant problem facing the non-aqueous Li-O2 battery. Here we show that incorporation of a redox mediator, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), enables recharging at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator. On charging, TTF is oxidized to TTF(+) at the cathode surface; TTF(+) in turn oxidizes the solid Li2O2, which results in the regeneration of TTF. The mediator acts as an electron-hole transfer agent that permits efficient oxidation of solid Li2O2. The cell with the mediator demonstrated 100 charge/discharge cycles.},

  Abstract                 = {Because of the remarkably high theoretical energy output, metal-air batteries represent one class of promising power sources for applications in next-generation electronics, electrified transportation and energy storage of smart grids. The most prominent feature of a metal-air battery is the combination of a metal anode with high energy density and an air electrode with open structure to draw cathode active materials (i.e., oxygen) from air. In this critical review, we present the fundamentals and recent advances related to the fields of metal-air batteries, with a focus on the electrochemistry and materials chemistry of air electrodes. The battery electrochemistry and catalytic mechanism of oxygen reduction reactions are discussed on the basis of aqueous and organic electrolytes. Four groups of extensively studied catalysts for the cathode oxygen reduction/evolution are selectively surveyed from materials chemistry to electrode properties and battery application: Pt and Pt-based alloys (e.g., PtAu nanoparticles), carbonaceous materials (e.g., graphene nanosheets), transition-metal oxides (e.g., Mn-based spinels and perovskites), and inorganic-organic composites (e.g., metal macrocycle derivatives). The design and optimization of air-electrode structure are also outlined. Furthermore, remarks on the challenges and perspectives of research directions are proposed for further development of metal-air batteries (219 references).},

The morphology of PTFE and Nafion in a simulated catalyst layer is examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that the platinum utilization of the thin-film catalyst layer containing only Pt/C and Nafion is 45.4\%. The low utilization is attributed to the fact that the electron conduction of many catalyst particles is impaired by some thick Nafion layers or clumps. For the gas-diffusion (E-TEK) electrode, the platinum utilization is mainly affected by the proton conduction provided by Nafion. The blocking effect of PTFE on the active sites is not serious. When the electrode is sufficiently impregnated with Nafion by an immersion method, the platinum utilization can reach 77.8\%. Transmission electron micrographs reveal that although some thick Nafion layers and clumps are observed in the Pt/C+Nafion layer, the distribution of Nafion in the catalyst layer is basically uniform. The melted PTFE disperses in the catalyst layer very uniformly. No large PTFE clumps or wide net-like structure is observed. The reactant gas may have to diffuse evenly in the catalyst layer.},

  abstract  = {An investigation is made of the effects of the change of the porosity of the gas diffuser layer (GDL) on the performance of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The analysis of fuel cell performance with non-uniform porosity of GDL is a necessity because the presence of liquid water in the GDL leads to a non-uniformly distributed porosity in the GDL. To implement this performance analysis, a half-cell model which considers the oxygen mass fraction distribution in the gas channel, the GDL and the catalyst layer, and the current density and the membrane phase potential in the catalyst layer and the membrane is investigated. Four continuous functions of position are employed to describe the porosity, and differential equations are derived based on oxygen transportation and Ohm{\textquoteright}s law for proton migration and solved numerically. Results show that a fuel cell embedded with a GDL with a larger averaged porosity will consume a greater amount of oxygen, so that a higher current density is generated and a better fuel cell performance is obtained. This explains partly why fuel cell performance deteriorates significantly as the cathode is flooded with water (i.e. to give a lower effective porosity in the GDL). In terms of the system performance, a change in GDL porosity has virtually no influence on the level of polarization when the current density is medium or lower, but exerts a significant influence when the current density is high. This finding supports the scenario proposed by previous studies that the polarization at high current density corresponds mainly to mass transfer through (or the concentration activation of) the membrane assembly.},

The mathematical problem involves the steady Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for a binary electrolyte with nonlinear boundary conditions for reaction kinetics and Stern-layer capacitance, as well as an integral constraint on the number of anions. At the limiting current, we find a nested boundary layer structure at the cathode, which is required by the reaction boundary condition. Above the limiting current, a depletion of anions generally characterizes the cathode side of the cell. In this regime, we derive leading-order asymptotic approximations for the (i) classical bulk space-charge layer and (ii) another, nested highly charged boundary layer at the cathode. The former involves an exact solution to the Nernst-Planck equations for a single, unscreened ionic species, which may apply more generally to Faradaic conduction through very thin insulating films. By matching expansions, we derive current-voltage relations well into the space-charge regime. Throughout our analysis, we emphasize the strong influence of the Stern-layer capacitance on cell behavior.},

Here we demonstrate a new type of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube/nanoparticle composite oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst obtained from iron acetate as an iron precursor and from cyanamide as a nitrogen and carbon nanotube precursor in a simple, scalable and single-step method. The composite has the highest oxygen reduction reaction activity in alkaline media of any non-precious metal catalysts. When used at a sufficiently high loading, this catalyst also outperforms the most active platinum-based catalysts.},

We utilize this work to analyze two-dimensional systems relevant for fuel cell science via the finite element method (FEM). Alternate current impedance spectroscopy (AC-IS or IS) of a ceria symmetric cell is simulated near equilibrium conditions (zero bias) for a wide array of working conditions including variations of temperature and H(2) partial pressure on a two-dimensional doped ceria sample with patterned metal electrodes. The model shows agreement between computed IS curves and the experimental literature where the relative error on the impedance is consistently below 2%. Important two-dimensional effects such as the impact of thickness decrease and the influence of variable electronic and ionic diffusivities on the impedance spectra are also explored.},

Anisotropic elastic stiffness and misfit strains lead to the unexpected prediction that low-energy phase boundaries occur along \{101\} planes, while conflicting reports of phase boundary orientations are resolved by a partial loss of coherency in the [001] direction. Elastic relaxation near surfaces leads to the formation of a striped morphology with a characteristic length scale predicted by the model, yielding an estimate of the interfacial energy. The effects of coherency strain on solubility and galvanostatic discharge are studied with a reaction-limited phase-field model that quantitatively captures the influence of misfit strain, particle size, and temperature on solubility seen in experiments. Coherency strain strongly suppresses phase separation during discharge, which enhances rate capability and extends cycle life. The effects of elevated temperature and the feasibility of nucleation are considered in the context of multiparticle cathodes.},

In addition, it is shown that the impedance of the air cathode-electrolyte interface is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the anode. Equivalent circuit fitting parameters indicate the difference in the anode-electrolyte interface characteristics for different types of silicon wafers. Evolution of porous silicon surfaces at the anode and their properties, by means of estimated circuit parameters, is also presented. Moreover, it is found that the silicon anode potential has the highest negative impact on the battery discharge voltage, while the air cathode potential is actually stable and invariable along the whole discharge period.

Detailed density-functional quantum mechanical calculations and crystal structure optimizations were carried out on both structures and the energetic arguments obtained therewith helped to rule out one of them.},

Here, we explore the influence of the catalyst could have on the performance of a non-aqueous O2 electrode on a Li/O2 cell.

Co3O4 gives the best compromise between initial capacity (2000 mA h g-1) and capacity retention (6.5\% per cycle), as well as the lowest charging voltage 4 V.

The model is parameterized using in-house half-cell experiments and available literature data on aqueous electrolytes. We validate our transport model with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements over a wide range of temperatures (25, 40, 55 $\deg$C) and electrolyte concentrations (0.1-2 M). We observe very good agreement between simulations and measurements during oxygen reduction conditions.

  Abstract                 = {This analysis evaluates several operational benefits of electricity storage, including load-leveling, spinning contingency reserves, and regulation reserves. Storage devices were simulated in a utility system in the western United States, and the operational costs of generation was compared to the same system without the added storage. This operational value of storage was estimated for devices of various sizes, providing different services, and with several sensitivities to fuel price and other factors. Overall, the results followed previous analyses that demonstrate relatively low value for load-leveling but greater value for provision of reserve services. The value was estimated by taking the difference in operational costs between cases with and without energy storage and represents the operational cost savings from deploying storage by a traditional vertically integrated utility. The analysis also estimated the potential revenues derived from a merchant storage plant in a restructured market, based on marginal system prices. Due to suppression of on-/off-peak price differentials and incomplete capture of system benefits (such as the cost of power plant starts), the revenue obtained by storage in a market setting appears to be substantially less than the net benefit provided to the system. This demonstrates some of the additional challenges for storage deployed in restructured energy markets.},

	abstract={Theoretical calculations and experimental results have clearly demonstrated that a composite electrode should exhibit low activation polarisation by spreading the electrochemical active area within the volume of the electrode. The present modelling has been performed in order to give a complete description of such an electrode structure as well as the processes occurring therein. A one-dimension flooded homogeneous model and a microscopic approach were used. The cathode was assumed to be composed of spherical particles of ionic (YSZ) and electronic conductors (M). The porous mixture of spherical grains was described as a face-centred cubic lattice. The microstructural parameters of interest include: the electrode thickness (L), the grain diameter (dYSZ = dM = dg), the porosity (ɛ), the specific adsorption surface area ( a v ads ), the specific electrochemical surface area ( a v tpb ), the pore diameter (dp) and the composition (ɛa). The proposed approach defines three independent parameters: ɛ, dg and ɛa. For a given electrode composition, the results suggest that the nature of the rate determining step depends on grain size. An optimised porosity value is also determined.

  abstract  = {Carbon possesses unique electrical and structural properties that make it an ideal material for use in fuel cell construction. In alkaline, phosphoric acid and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), carbon is used in fabricating the bipolar plate and the gas-diffusion layer. It can also act as a support for the active metal in the catalyst layer. Various forms of carbon -- from graphite and carbon blacks to composite materials -- have been chosen for fuel-cell components. The development of carbon nanotubes and the emergence of nanotechnology in recent years has therefore opened up new avenues of materials development for the low-temperature fuel cells, particularly the hydrogen PEMFC and the direct methanol PEMFC. Carbon nanotubes and aerogels are also being investigated for use as catalyst support, and this could lead to the production of more stable, high activity catalysts, with low platinum loadings (<0.1mgcm$-$2) and therefore low cost. Carbon can also be used as a fuel in high-temperature fuel cells based on solid oxide, alkaline or molten carbonate technology. In the direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC), the energy of combustion of carbon is converted to electrical power with a thermodynamic efficiency close to 100\%. The DCFC could therefore help to extend the use of fossil fuels for power generation as society moves towards a more sustainable energy future.},

  abstract  = {The flow distribution in fuel cells has an important influence on both the power density and efficiency of fuel cell systems. In order to effectively utilize the area, flow distribution should be as homogeneous as possible. In addition, pressure losses should be minimized with regard to the power demand of auxiliary components as pumps and compressors. In polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) the flow field is in direct contact with the diffusion layer. The main task of the diffusion layer is to distribute the reactants from the flow field towards the catalyst layer. To prevent diffusion overvoltages, the diffusion layer is in general highly porous and provides high fluxes of the reactants. Consequently, the flow distribution in the flow field can be superpositioned by a flow in the diffusion layer. In this paper, we discuss the interaction between the diffusion layer and the flow field. Experimentally, we characterized different diffusion layers with regard to their diffusion properties as well as different flow fields. Additional simulation studies help to understand the processes and to determine suitable combinations of flow fields and diffusion layers.},

  Abstract                 = {Single chambered air-cathode microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are promising to be scaled up as sustainable wastewater treatment systems. However, the current air-cathode made by brushing noble metal catalyst and Nafion binder onto carbon matrix becomes one of the biggest bottlenecks for the further development of MFCs due to its high cost, huge labor-consuming and less accuracy. A novel structure of air-cathode was constructed here by rolling activated carbon (AC) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as catalyst layer to enhance the reproducibility and improve the performance by an optimized three-phase interface (TPI). Air-cathodes with AC/PTFE ratios of 3, 5, 6, 8 and 11 in the catalyst layer were prepared, and the physical and electrochemical techniques were employed to investigate their surface microstructure and electrochemical characteristics. Uniform cross-linked ropiness networks were observed from the catalyst layer of all the cathodes and increased as the AC/PTFE ratio decreased, while the exchange currents were positively related to this ratio. Maximum power densities (MPDs) decreased as follows: AC/PTFE{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 6 (802{\^{A}} mW{\^{A}} m(-2) at 3.4{\^{A}} A{\^{A}} m(-2)), 5 (704{\^{A}} mW{\^{A}} m(-2) at 2.2{\^{A}} mA{\^{A}} m(-2)), 8 (647{\^{A}} mW{\^{A}} m(-2) at 2.2{\^{A}} A{\^{A}} m(-2)), 3 (597{\^{A}} mW{\^{A}} m(-2) at 2.1{\^{A}} A{\^{A}} m(-2)) and 11 (584{\^{A}} mW{\^{A}} m(-2) at 2.0{\^{A}} mA{\^{A}} m(-2)), which was due to the changes of both the capacitance characteristics and conductivities according to the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) analysis. This study demonstrated that inexpensive, highly reproducible, high performance and scalable air-cathode can be produced by rolling method without using noble metal and expensive binder.},

Here we report a cathode architecture based on nanoscale components that results in a dramatic reduction in charge overpotential to {\~{}}0.2 V. The cathode utilizes atomic layer deposition of palladium nanoparticles on a carbon surface with an alumina coating for passivation of carbon defect sites. The low charge potential is enabled by the combination of palladium nanoparticles attached to the carbon cathode surface, a nanocrystalline form of lithium peroxide with grain boundaries, and the alumina coating preventing electrolyte decomposition on carbon. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy provides evidence for the nanocrystalline form of lithium peroxide. The new cathode material architecture provides the basis for future development of lithium-oxygen cathode materials that can be used to improve the efficiency and to extend cycle life.},

Reported values of evaporation coefficient of water range from 0.1 to 1 and despite many attempts to explain this large variation the evaporation coefficient is still a subject of dispute. Three explanations which have often been used to account for low evaporation coefficients are: molecular structure, molecular collision in the vapour phase and heat transfer limitations in the liquid phase. Following an extensive discussion, it is concluded that molecular collision and heat transfer limitations can have a considerable influence on experimental evaporation rates and thus apparent evaporation coefficients. However, it now seems unlikely that molecular structure has a major effect on this coefficient. We conclude from this investigation that for pure water evaporating into a space containing only water vapour, the true evaporation coefficient is unity under all conditions of pressure and temperature.},

  abstract  = {A known macrohomogeneous model for the cathode catalyst layer of a low temperature fuel cell, which includes the kinetics of oxygen reduction at the catalyst∣electrolyte interface, proton transport through the polymer electrolyte network, and oxygen diffusion through hydrophobized voids, is considered. Analytical expressions in the relevant ranges of parameter values are obtained. These are the limits of (i) small currents, (ii) fast oxygen diffusion, (iii) fast proton transport, (iv) high current densities (when the layer is depleted in oxygen). They help to trace the main system properties and operation modes, and the routes for the structure-function optimization. Namely, they rationalize the explicit effect of the kinetic parameters of the oxygen reduction on the performance, the effect of the catalyst layer thickness, the width and the position of the active fraction of the layer, and the dependence of the performance on the oxygen partial pressure. In current--voltage plots, three regions are distinguished, each dominated by one of the three main physico-chemical processes in the cathode. Ranges of the optimum cathode thickness are revealed depending on the current density regimes. A bridge between the structural composition of the cathode and its performance is built with the help of an effective medium theory; the model reproduces the experimentally observed trends.},

Physical and electrical characteristics of the GDLs are reported. The results show that the substrate structure has a significant effect on the mechanical and electrical properties of the GDL. Moreover, the Micro Porous Layer (MPL) structure determines the roughness of the surface, and affects the permeability and porosity of the GDL. It was found that the substrate treatment with PTFE affects the GDL characteristics; PTFE loading increases the GDLs hydrophobicity and permeability, however, decreases its overall porosity and resistivity. Adding a MPL to the substrate, results in a decrease in porosity and permeability and an increase in resistivity. The contact resistance of the GDL and the bipolar plate increases when the GDL thickness and PTFE loading are increased. This technical paper shows a close relationship between GDL materials and their physical characteristics and highlights the importance of optimising GDLs for fuel cell applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Transition metal phosphates such as LiFePO(4) have been recognized as very promising electrodes for lithium-ion batteries because of their energy storage capacity combined with electrochemical and thermal stability. A key issue in these materials is to unravel the factors governing electron and ion transport within the lattice. Lithium extraction from LiFePO(4) results in a two-phase mixture with FePO(4) that limits the power characteristics owing to the low mobility of the phase boundary. This boundary is a consequence of low solubility of the parent phases, and its mobility is impeded by slow migration of the charge carriers. In principle, these limitations could be diminished in a solid solution, Li(x)FePO(4). Here, we show that electron delocalization in the solid solution phases formed at elevated temperature is due to rapid small polaron hopping and is unrelated to consideration of the band gap. We give the first experimental evidence for a strong correlation between electron and lithium delocalization events that suggests they are coupled. Furthermore, the exquisite frequency sensitivity of M\"{o}ssbauer measurements provides direct insight into the electron hopping rate.},

In this work, the formation process of $\alpha$-FeOOH by air oxidation of Fe(OH)2 suspensions has been studied. The effects of the air flow rate, as well as of the reactant concentration ratio, R (=[(OH)?]/[Fe(II)]), on the reaction product were analyzed. It has been found that the morphology and the size of the $\alpha$-FeOOH particles can be modified by means of the air flow rate. Furthermore, by performing a detailed microscopic analysis of the morphology of the initial, intermediate, and final reaction products, we have obtained evidence of epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-FeOOH on the Fe(OH)2 substrate. It is suggested that the similarity between the anion arrangements in both phases facilitates this process. Based on these results, a pathway for the formation of $\alpha$-FeOOH in highly alkaline medium is proposed in which the size and shape of the initial Fe(OH)2 particles plays a significant role in the formation the $\alpha$-FeOOH particles obtained upon completion of the oxidation process.},

It has been observed that decreasing the stress applied on the GDL, which is of high interest for the durability of the MEAs, has moreover a positive effect on their performance.},

Two different types of boundary conditions on the electrodes are compared. One type describes the exchange of charges between the volume and the external circuit, in the form originally proposed by Chang and Jaff{\'{e}} and later extended to include specific adsorption, where the surface current density is proportional to the variation of the surface bulk density of ions with respect to the value of equilibrium. The other one describes the surface adsorption, in the limit of Langmuir. We show that in the simple case where the ions dissolved in the insulating liquid are identical in all the aspects, except for the sign of the charge, the two models are equivalent only if the phenomenological parameter entering the boundary condition of the Chang-Jaff{\'{e}} model, {$\kappa$}, is frequency dependent, and related to the adsorption coefficient, k(a), in the form {$\kappa$} = i{$\omega$}{$\tau$}/(1 + i{$\omega$}{$\tau$})k(a), where {$\tau$} is the desorption time and {$\omega$} the circular frequency of the applied voltage, as proposed long ago by Macdonald.},

  Abstract                 = {Porous electrodes composed of multiphase active materials are widely used in Li-ion batteries, but their dynamics are poorly understood. Two-phase models are largely empirical, and no models exist for three or more phases. Using a modified porous electrode theory based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we show that experimental phase behavior can be accurately predicted from free energy models, without artificially placing phase boundaries or fitting the open circuit voltage. First, we simulate lithium intercalation in porous iron phosphate, a popular two-phase cathode, and show that the zero-current voltage gap, sloping voltage plateau and under-estimated exchange currents all result from size-dependent nucleation and mosaic instability. Next, we simulate porous graphite, the standard anode with three stable phases, and reproduce experimentally observed fronts of color-changing phase transformations. These results provide a framework for physics-based design and control for electrochemical systems with complex thermodynamics.},

  abstract  = {The dissolution of a compound results in the introduction and generation of gas bubbles in the solvent. This formation is due to entrained gases adhered to or trapped within the particles. Furthermore, a reduction in gas solubility due to the solute results in additional bubble generation. Their presence increases the compressibility of the solvent with the added effect of reducing the velocity of sound in the solvent. This effect is monitored via the frequency change of acoustic resonances that are mechanically provoked in the solvent and are now used as an insightful analytical technique. An experimental set up was designed to study a large number of compounds as a function of time, concentration, and solvent system. This revealed the role of the various physical and chemical mechanisms in determining the observed response. It is also shown that this response is strongly dependent on the physical and chemical characteristics of the solute compound used, therefore resulting in a method for the characterization of compounds and mixtures. Additional factors such as morphology (polymorphism), particle size, and dissolution rate are shown to be key in the variation of the resulting response. A mathematical model has also been developed in parallel, which inter-relates the various processes involved in the observed response. It is anticipated that BARDS will open up a new window into transient dissolution processes and compound characterization.},

The current density distribution in the cathode exhibits a sharp maximum at the 3PB and a major fraction of the total current flows in narrow zones with a width of a few percent of the electrode particle size (e.g. in the case of 1.6 ??m particle size: approximately 2/3 of the current flows in a zone with a width of 60nm). Hence, the corresponding polarisation resistance is almost inversely proportional to the 3PB length. In a wide parameter range an increasing ionic conductivity of the mixed conductor does not broaden the electrochemically active region. A formula is presented which allows an estimate of the polarisation resistance of a mixed conducting electrode if ionic transport through the electrode bulk is rate limiting. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Micro-SOFCs may be operated in either a single-chamber mode for which both electrodes are located on one side of a thin film electrolyte or in the more conventional two-chamber mode, in which electrodes are located on opposite sides of the electrolyte. The electrode geometries and film thicknesses necessary to achieve sufficiently low polarization resistances are evaluated for the single-chamber micro-SOFC. Interdigitated (comb-like) electrodes with characteristic feature sizes of a few micrometers are found to be essential to insure low polarization resistance. Requirements with respect to electrochemical properties of the electrodes are addressed as well. Numerical calculations are used to examine the correlation between decreasing electrolyte film thickness and ohmic polarization in two-chamber fuel cells. Current constriction at electrode particles or three phase boundaries render very low film thicknesses (below say 300 nm) not very sensible. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A study of the impedance response of a 150 cm2 six-cell air/H2 PEM fuel cell as a function of inlet gas relative humidity was carried out. Parameters of a Randles-like equivalent circuit were then fitted to the data. In order to improve the quality of the fit, the classical Randles cell was extended by changing the standard plane capacitor into a constant phase element (CPE). It was found that monitoring the evolution of the three resistances of this modified Randles model was an efficient and robust way of monitoring the state-of-health (SOH) of the fuel cell with respect to the water content of the membrane electrode assembly. Moreover, the non-integer power of the CPE was found to be statistically constant over a wide range of operating conditions, thus comforting the assumption that it has a physical meaning.

More particularly, deep insight based on multiscale physical modelling techniques, spanning scales from few atoms to the device level, can advise about the materials behaviour and aging and how components with optimal specifications could be made and how they can be integrated into operating devices. Concepts and different existing multiscale modelling methodologies are presented and some of the ongoing efforts within the community to understand from physical multiscale modelling and numerical simulation electrochemical mechanisms and degradation processes in LIBs are discussed.

The impedance results were analysed in terms of the high frequency resistance, the contribution of the charge transfer due to the oxygen reduction reaction and a low frequency relaxation process. With respect to the system, the results are analysed in terms of the membrane thickness and history, the working temperature of the cell and the humidification conditions of the reactant gases, and show clearly that thinner membranes present better characteristics of water management, being much less sensitive to temperature and current density changes. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

The different pathways for discharge and charge are consistent with the widely observed voltage gap in Li-O(2) cells. Oxidation of C(3)H(6)(OCO(2)Li)(2) involves terminal carbonate groups leaving behind the OC(3)H(6)O moiety that reacts to form a thick gel on the Li anode. Li(2)CO(3), HCO(2)Li, CH(3)CO(2)Li, and C(3)H(6)(OCO(2)Li)(2) accumulate in the cathode on cycling correlating with capacity fading and cell failure. The latter is compounded by continuous consumption of the electrolyte on each discharge.},

Only easy steps were chosen in this preparation technique in order to simplify the method, aiming at cost reduction. The influence of MEA fabrication parameters like electrode pressing or annealing on the performance of hydrogen fuel cells was studied by single cell measurements with H2/O2 operation. Toray paper and carbon cloth as gas diffusion layer (GDL) materials were compared and the composition of electrode inks was optimized with regard to most favorable fuel cell performance. Commercial E-TEK catalyst was used on the anode and cathode with Pt loadings of 0.4 and 0.6mg/cm2, respectively. The MEA with best performance delivered approximately 0.58W/cm2, at 65$\deg$C cell temperature, 80$\deg$C anode humidification, dry cathode and ambient pressure on both electrodes. The results show, that changing electrode compositions or the use of different materials with same functionality (e.g. different GDLs), have a larger effect on fuel cell performance than changing preparation parameters like hot pressing or spraying conditions, studied in previous work.},

Three models of impedance response during the initial stage of passivation are presented, and are used in the analysis of a Zn/borax solution passive system. The most plausible mechanism of initial passivation in this system involved a time of induction followed by a process of gradual coverage of the metal surface with a passive film. During the process of coverage, the electrical properties of the already covered parts continued to change significantly with time.},

  Abstract                 = {Fundamental research into the Li-O2 battery system has gone into high gear, gaining momentum because of its very high theoretical specific energy. Much progress has been made toward understanding the discharge mechanism, but the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on charge (i.e., oxidation) remains less understood. Here, using operando X-ray diffraction, we show that oxidation of electrochemically generated Li2O2 occurs in two stages, but in one step for bulk crystalline (commercial) Li2O2, revealing a fundamental difference in the OER process depending on the nature of the peroxide. For electrochemically generated Li2O2, oxidation proceeds first through a noncrystalline lithium peroxide component, followed at higher potential by the crystalline peroxide via a Li deficient solid solution (Li2-xO2) phase. Anisotropic broadening of the X-ray Li2O2 reflections confirms a platelet crystallite shape. On the basis of the evolution of the broadening during charge, we speculate that the toroid particles are deconstructed one platelet at a time, starting with the smallest sizes that expose more peroxide surface. In the case of in situ charged bulk crystalline Li2O2, the Li vacancies preferentially form on the interlayer position (Li1), which is supported by first-principle calculations and consistent with their lower energy compared to those located next to oxygen (Li2). The small actively oxidizing fraction results in a gradual reduction of the Li2O2 crystallites.

  abstract  = {This study focuses on a determination of the cell voltage losses observed for Pt and PtRu loading reductions in H2/air and reformate/air polymer/electrolyte-membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Experiments with catalyst-coated membranes (CCM) of varying anode and cathode catalyst loadings with H2/O2 and H2/air demonstrate that the anode catalyst loading in state-of-the-art membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) operating on pure H2 can be reduced to 0.05mgPt/cm2 without significant voltage losses, while the cell voltage losses upon a reduction of the cathode catalyst loading from 0.40 to 0.20mgPt/cm2 for optimized MEAs amounts to 10--20mV, consistent with purely kinetic losses due to the oxygen reduction reaction. It is shown that H2/air operation with state-of-the-art MEAs very closely approaches the Pt-specific power density (in units of gPt/kW) for large-scale automotive fuel cell applications with pure H2 feed. For reformate/air operation, PtRu anode loadings can be reduced to 0.20mgPtRu/cm2 for reformate containing 100ppm CO with a 2\% air-bleed. Any further reduction will, however, require either a change in operating conditions (i.e. lower CO concentration or cell temperature ⪢80$\deg$C) or novel, more CO-tolerant anode catalysts.},

  abstract  = {The gas diffusion layer (GDL) plays a very important role in the performance of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The amount of compression on the GDL affects the contact resistance, the GDL porosity, and the fraction of the pores occupied by liquid water, which, in turn, affect the performance of a PEM fuel cell. In order to study the effects of GDL compression on fuel cell performance a unique fuel cell test fixture was designed and created such that, without disassembling the fuel cell, varying the compression of the GDL can be achieved both precisely and uniformly. Besides, the compression can be precisely measured and easily read out. Using this special fuel cell fixture, the effects of GDL compression on PEM fuel cell performance under various anode and cathode flow rates were studied. Two different GDL materials, carbon cloth double-sided ELAT and TORAY{\texttrademark} carbon fiber paper were used in these studies. The experimental results show that generally the fuel cell performance decreases with the increase in compression and over-compression probably exists in most fuel cells. In the low current density region, generally there exists an optimal compression ratio.},

We tested various percentages of MWCNTs and Vulcan XC72R in the MPLs of gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) with various Pt loadings in the catalyst layer. The performance of the ORR in the electrodes was studied with linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry. The structures of the MPLs were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury porosimetry (MP), and gas permeability. In addition, the optimum polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content of the MPL was determined. Our results indicate that the performances of the GDEs are optimal under the following conditions: (a) 60wt\% MWCNTs and 40wt\% Vulcan XC72R with a Pt loading of 0.115mg/cm2; (b) 80wt\% MWCNTs and 20wt\% Vulcan XC72R with a Pt loading of 0.5mg/cm2; and (c) 40wt\% MWCNTs and 60wt\% Vulcan XC72R with a Pt loading of 1mg/cm2.},

  Abstract                 = {The large-scale practical application of fuel cells will be difficult to realize if the expensive platinum-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) cannot be replaced by other efficient, low-cost, and stable electrodes. Here, we report that vertically aligned nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes (VA-NCNTs) can act as a metal-free electrode with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than platinum for oxygen reduction in alkaline fuel cells. In air-saturated 0.1 molar potassium hydroxide, we observed a steady-state output potential of -80 millivolts and a current density of 4.1 milliamps per square centimeter at -0.22 volts, compared with -85 millivolts and 1.1 milliamps per square centimeter at -0.20 volts for a platinum-carbon electrode. The incorporation of electron-accepting nitrogen atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane appears to impart a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms. This effect, coupled with aligning the NCNTs, provides a four-electron pathway for the ORR on VA-NCNTs with a superb performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Each cell of a battery stores electrical energy as chemical energy in two electrodes, a reductant (anode) and an oxidant (cathode), separated by an electrolyte that transfers the ionic component of the chemical reaction inside the cell and forces the electronic component outside the battery. The output on discharge is an external electronic current I at a voltage V for a time $\Delta$t. The chemical reaction of a rechargeable battery must be reversible on the application of a charging I and V. Critical parameters of a rechargeable battery are safety, density of energy that can be stored at a specific power input and retrieved at a specific power output, cycle and shelf life, storage efficiency, and cost of fabrication. Conventional ambient-temperature rechargeable batteries have solid electrodes and a liquid electrolyte. The positive electrode (cathode) consists of a host framework into which the mobile (working) cation is inserted reversibly over a finite solid-solution range. The solid-solution range, which is reduced at higher current by the rate of transfer of the working ion across electrode/electrolyte interfaces and within a host, limits the amount of charge per electrode formula unit that can be transferred over the time $\Delta$t = $\Delta$t(I). Moreover, the difference between energies of the LUMO and the HOMO of the electrolyte, i.e., electrolyte window, determines the maximum voltage for a long shelf and cycle life. The maximum stable voltage with an aqueous electrolyte is 1.5 V; the Li-ion rechargeable battery uses an organic electrolyte with a larger window, which increase the density of stored energy for a given $\Delta$t. Anode or cathode electrochemical potentials outside the electrolyte window can increase V, but they require formation of a passivating surface layer that must be permeable to Li(+) and capable of adapting rapidly to the changing electrode surface area as the electrode changes volume during cycling. A passivating surface layer adds to the impedance of the Li(+) transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface and lowers the cycle life of a battery cell. Moreover, formation of a passivation layer on the anode robs Li from the cathode irreversibly on an initial charge, further lowering the reversible $\Delta$t. These problems plus the cost of quality control of manufacturing plague development of Li-ion rechargeable batteries that can compete with the internal combustion engine for powering electric cars and that can provide the needed low-cost storage of electrical energy generated by renewable wind and/or solar energy. Chemists are contributing to incremental improvements of the conventional strategy by investigating and controlling electrode passivation layers, improving the rate of Li(+) transfer across electrode/electrolyte interfaces, identifying electrolytes with larger windows while retaining a Li(+) conductivity $\sigma$(Li) > 10(-3) S cm(-1), synthesizing electrode morphologies that reduce the size of the active particles while pinning them on current collectors of large surface area accessible by the electrolyte, lowering the cost of cell fabrication, designing displacement-reaction anodes of higher capacity that allow a safe, fast charge, and designing alternative cathode hosts. However, new strategies are needed for batteries that go beyond powering hand-held devices, such as using electrode hosts with two-electron redox centers; replacing the cathode hosts by materials that undergo displacement reactions (e.g. sulfur) by liquid cathodes that may contain flow-through redox molecules, or by catalysts for air cathodes; and developing a Li(+) solid electrolyte separator membrane that allows an organic and aqueous liquid electrolyte on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Opportunities exist for the chemist to bring together oxide and polymer or graphene chemistry in imaginative morphologies.},

The technique employed can measure capillary pressure curves for both the total pore network and the pore network consisting of only hydrophilic pores. This enables the determination of capillary pressure curves directly relevant to the study of gas diffusion layer flooding. The overall distributions compared well with mercury intrusion data. It was found that the pore size distribution for the hydrophilic pores were similar in shape to the overall distribution for standard substrate materials. Materials with a microporous layer did not follow this trend and the microporous layer was found to be completely hydrophobic. Due to their similarity, the overall and hydrophilic capillary pressure curves for all materials could be correlated using a single Leverett J-function. The results were described by several standard capillary models, the parameters of which can be further used to predict the relative permeability of the phases.},

  abstract  = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {Li-O2 batteries with super-high theoretical energy density are attracting extensive attention. However, the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reaction, the huge volume change from O2/Li2O2 conversion and the undesired electrolyte decomposition in cathode limit their performance. Herein we show design and synthesis of RuO2-coated ordered mesoporous carbon nanofiber arrays by using a natural crab shell template as a catalyst for Li-O2 battery, exhibiting several advantage features. First, the ordered mesopores in nanofibers facilitate electrolyte penetration and electron/ion transfer. In addition, the macro-sized voids between the nanofibers provide efficient buffer space for O2/Li2O2 accommodation and improve O2 diffusion. Furthermore, the uniform RuO2-coating layer alleviates undesired electrolyte decomposition and enhances the surface electronic conductivity. As a result, the battery displays high performance, including high capacity (20600{~}mAh{~}g$-$1 at a current density of 100{~}mA{~}g$-$1), high rate (9750{~}mAh{~}g$-$1 at a current density of 1000{~}mA{~}g$-$1) and long-life (300 cycles at a fixed capacity of 1000{~}mAh{~}g$-$1).},

Here we describe a method for determining separately the in-plane (x, y-directions) and through-plane (z-direction), viscous and inertial permeability coefficients of macro-porous substrates and micro-porous layers by controlling the direction of the gas flow through the porous sample. The method is applied initially to the macro-porous substrate of the GDL alone and subsequently to the macro-porous substrate with different micro-porous layers applied on it. The permeability coefficients of the micro-porous layer are calculated from the two measurements. The permeability coefficients are calculated from the Darcy--Forchheimer equation by application of the method of least squares. The method was applied to GDLs having different contents of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon types. The samples with a higher PTFE content have in-plane and through-plane viscous permeability coefficients higher than those of the samples with lower PTFE content. The in-plane and through-plane viscous permeability coefficients also depend on the carbon type.},

  abstract  = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Fifty years after Kramers{'} seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers{'} reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers{'} work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers{'} theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers{'} reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

  abstract  = {The electrical double layer characteristics and oxygen electroreduction kinetics in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution has been studied at micromesoporous tungsten carbide derived carbon C(WC) electrodes. Carbon powders with various specific surface areas (1280-2116 m2 g -1) have been prepared from WC at chlorination temperatures 900 $\deg$C, 1000 $\deg$C and 1100 $\deg$C. The porous structure of carbon substrate was characterised using nitrogen sorption, X-ray diffraction, high resolution TEM, electron energy loss spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy methods. Cyclic voltammograms at various potential scan rates from 2 to 70 mV s -1, and rotating disc electrode data at rotation velocities from 0 to 3000 rev min-1, were measured within the region of potentials from +0.4 V to -0.6 V vs. Hg|Hg2SO4|sat.K2SO 4 in H2O (MSE). At E > -0.2 V, the electroreduction of oxygen is mainly limited by the charge transfer step, and at -0.6 V < E < -0.2 V, by the mixed kinetics. The oxygen electroreduction mainly proceeds through the peroxide formation intermediate step on all electrodes studied. Despite of that the electrodes tested were very stable during the electrochemical experiment, indicating that the C(WC) is a suitable catalyst support material for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. The electroreduction rate of oxygen depends strongly on the structure (graphitisation level) of carbide derived carbon used for preparation of an electrode and the oxygen reduction overvoltage decreases in the order C(WC) 1100 $\deg$C > C(WC) 1000 $\deg$C > C(WC) 900 $\deg$C. Very high low-frequency capacitance values, independent of alternative current (ac) frequency at f < 0.1 Hz, have been established for C(WC) 1100 $\deg$C, demonstrating that at ac f $\rightarrow$ 0, mainly pseudocapacitive behaviour with adsorption limited step of reaction intermediates has been observed. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The CFGDL consists of a PE-704 carbon electrode backing filled with a mixture of carbon powder and PTFE. The results obtained from the performance evaluation and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses indicate that the loading of the carbon powder in the CFGDL plays a critical role in the performance of the fuel cell and utilization of Pt, but the presence of PTFE in the CFGDL has less influence. The carbon content in the CFGDL not only affects the area specific resistance of the CFGDL but also affects the Pt utilization of the catalyst layer, the total cell resistance and thus the cell performance. The optimal performance of the PEFC was obtained when the CFGDL was filled with carbon to 6mgcm$-$2 and PTFE of 40\%. The relationship between the surface morphology and microstructure of the CFGDL and the electrocatalytic activity of the cell is also discussed.},

  abstract  = {A carbon-filled gas diffusion layer (CFGDL), which is in the configuration similar to conventional carbon cloth gas diffusion layer (GDL) coated with carbon layer on both faces, was investigated and compared with conventional carbon paper-based single-layer and dual-layer GDLs. Like the carbon cloth GDL, CFGDL has presented superior performances over the single-layer or dual-layer GDL in all three polarization (activation, ohmic and concentration) controlled regions under electrochemical characterizations (steady-state polarization and electrochemical impedance spectra). The results from SEM showed that CFGDL has the same thickness of 0.11mm as that of single-layer GDL, while dual-layer GDL has a thickness of 0.18mm. The fully filled carbon paper with carbon/PTFE filler, as seen in the SEM image, displayed good support for the catalyst layer and electrolyte phase, allowing good electrical contact between the GDL/catalyst/membrane and GDL/flow field plate to be achieved. From porosimetry analysis, CFGDL presented a lower porosity of 67\% and a much smaller average pore diameter of 4.7$\mu$m compared to the single-layer GDL (porosity of 77\% and pore diameter of 35.8$\mu$m) and dual-layer GDL (porosity of 73\% and pore diameter of 25.5$\mu$m); however, it also gave the largest limiting current density, which reflects the improvement in mass transportation. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the fast removal of micro-water droplets formed in the CFGDL structure of the electrode.},

  abstract      = {In the high-temperature (\$T\_\{c\}\$) cuprate superconductors, increasing evidence suggests that the pseudogap, existing below the pseudogap temperature \$T\$*, has a distinct broken electronic symmetry from that of superconductivity. Particularly, recent scattering experiments on the underdoped cuprates have suggested that a charge ordering competes with superconductivity. However, no direct link of this physics and the important low-energy excitations has been identified. Here we report an antagonistic singularity at \$T\_\{c\}\$ in the spectral weight of Bi\$\_\{2\}\$Sr\$\_\{2\}\$CaCu\$\_\{2\}\$O\$\_\{8+\{\backslash delta\}\}\$ as a compelling evidence for phase competition, which persists up to a high hole concentration \$p\$ \~{} 0.22. Comparison with a theoretical calculation confirms that the singularity is a signature of competition between the order parameters for the pseudogap and superconductivity. The observation of the spectroscopic singularity at finite temperatures over a wide doping range provides new insights into the nature of the competitive interplay between the two intertwined phases and the complex phase diagram near the pseudogap critical point.},

However, the water that is produced electrochemically at the cathode catalyst layer can condense in the cell and cause an obstruction to the diffusion of reaction gas in the gas diffusion layer and the gas channel. This leads to a sudden decrease of the cell voltage. To combat this, strict water management techniques are required, which usually focus on the gas diffusion layer. In this study, the use of specially treated carbon paper as a flood-proof gas diffusion layer under extremely high humidity conditions was investigated experimentally. The results indicated that flooding originates at the interface between the gas diffusion layer and the catalyst layer, and that such flooding could be eliminated by control of the pore size in the gas diffusion layer at this interface.},

In this Letter we develop a nanoscale continuum model for the growth of Li2O2 crystals in lithium-oxygen batteries with organic electrolytes, based on a theory of electrochemical non-equilibrium thermodynamics originally applied to Li-ion batteries. As in the case of lithium insertion in phase-separating LiFePO4 nanoparticles, the theory predicts a transition from complex to uniform morphologies of Li2O2 with increasing current. Discrete particle growth at low discharge rates becomes suppressed at high rates, resulting in a film of electronically insulating Li2O2 that limits cell performance. We predict that the transition between these surface growth modes occurs at current densities close to the exchange current density of the cathode reaction, consistent with experimental observations.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we report the use of binary carbon supports (carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active carbon) as a catalyst layer for fabricating gas diffusion electrodes. The electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were evaluated by polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in an alkaline electrolyte. The binary-support electrode exhibits better performance than the single-support electrode, and the best performance is obtained when the mass ratio of carbon nanotubes and active carbon is 50:50. The results from the electrode kinetic parameters indicate that the introduction of carbon nanotubes as a secondary support provides high accessible surface area, good electronic conductivity, and fast ORR kinetics. Furthermore, the effect of CNT support on the electrocatalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles for binary-support electrodes was also investigated by different loading-reduction methods. The electrocatalytic activity of the binary-support electrodes is improved dramatically by Pt loading on CNT carbon support, even at very low Pt loading. Additionally, the EIS analysis results indicate that the process of ORR may be controlled by diffusion of oxygen in the electrode thin film for binary-support electrodes with or without Pt catalyst.},

This article demonstrates that a bifunctional catalyst composed of Pt and IrO2 supported on carbon nanotubes can address this problem. The specially designed and synthesized bifunctional catalyst showed significant overpotential reduction and achieved a round trip energy efficiency of 81\% after 10 cycles, higher than many achieved in aprotic Li-O2 batteries. The hybrid Li-air battery was discharged and recharged for 20 cycles at 0.2 mA/cm2, showing a fairly stable cell performance. A specific capacity of 306 mAh/g and a specific energy of 1110 Wh/kg were obtained for the hybrid Li-air battery in terms of acid weight. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {A three-dimensional, two-phase, non-isothermal model has been developed to explore the interaction between heat and water transport in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Water condensate produced from the electrochemical reaction may accumulate in the open pores of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and retard the oxygen transport to the catalyst sites. This study predicts the enhancement of the water transport for linear porosity gradient in the cathode GDL of a PEMFC. An optimal porosity distribution was found based on a parametric study. Results show that a optimal linear porosity gradient with ɛ1{~}={~}0.7 and ɛ2{~}={~}0.3 for the parallel and z-serpentine channel design leads to a maximum increase in the limiting current density from 10,696{~}Am$-$2 to 13,136{~}Am$-$2 and 14,053{~}Am$-$2 to 16,616{~}Am$-$2 at 0.49{~}V, respectively. On the other hand, the oxygen usage also increases from 36\% to 46\% for the parallel channel design and from 55\% to 67\% for the z-serpentine channel design. The formation of a porosity gradient in the GDL enhances the capillary diffusivity, increases the electrical conductivity, and hence, benefits the oxygen transport throughout the GDL. The present study provides a theoretical support for existing reports that a GDL with a gradient porosity improves cell performance.},

We argue that this is a reasonable model to describe discharge and charge of Li-O(2) batteries over most of the discharge-charge cycle. Because non-stoichiometric surfaces are potential dependent and since the potential varies during discharge and charge, we study the thermodynamic stability of facets, terminations, and steps as a function of potential. This suggests that different facets, terminations, and sites may dominate in charge relative to those for discharge. We find very low thermodynamic overpotentials (<0.2 V) for both discharge and charge at many sites on the facets studied. These low thermodynamic overpotentials for both discharge and charge are in very good agreement with the low kinetic overpotentials observed in recent experiments. However, there are other predicted paths for discharge/charge that have higher overpotentials, so the phase space available for the electrochemistry opens up with overpotential.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation electrochemical energy storage for integrated microsystems and consumer electronic devices requires novel electrode materials with engineered architectures to meet the requirements of high performance, low cost, and robustness. However, conventional electrode fabrication processes such as doctor blading afford limited control over the electrode thickness and structure at the nanoscale and require the incorporation of insulating binder and other additives, which can promote agglomeration and reduce active surface area, limiting the inherent advantages attainable from nanoscale materials. We have engineered a route for the synthesis of highly stable, sub-8 nm TiO2 nanoparticles and their subsequent incorporation with acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) into nanostructured electrodes using aqueous-based layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly. Using this approach, binder-free thin film electrodes with highly controllable thicknesses up to the micrometer scale were developed with well-dispersed, nonagglomerated TiO2 nanoparticles on MWNTs. Upon testing in an Li electrochemical half-cell, these electrodes demonstrate high capacity (>150 mAh/gel(ectrode) at 0.1 A/gel(ectrode)), good rate capability (>100 mAh/gel(ectrode) up to 1 A/g(electrode)) and nearly no capacity loss up to 200 cycles for electrodes with thicknesses up to 1480 nm, indicating their promise as thin-film negative electrodes for future Li storage applications.},

The contents of Al and Sn were below 3.0 wt.\%. Ac impedance analysis revealed that Li-Al electrodes showed relatively low and stable resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the electrode immersion in the electrolyte as well as during charge-discharge cycling. On the other hand, a Li-Sn electrode gave higher interfacial resistance than a {\textquotedblleft}pure{\textquotedblright} Li electrode. Cyclic voltammetry measurement and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling test revealed the Li-Al electrode exhibited small polarization from the ideal redox potential of Li/Li+ during charging and discharging while the Li-Sn electrode showed relatively large polarization. The polarization behavior of the various electrodes correlated with the interfacial resistance characterized by the ac impedance measurement.},

  abstract  = {Transmission line model (TLM) is often used for the analysis of porous electrode since the current distribution in the pore can be calculated. In the present paper, the TLM is applied to the impedance analysis of complicated porous electrode with fractal structure. Activated carbon is used as electrode material for electric double layer capacitor and its pore has branch structure. Considering the fractal structure of the activated carbon, we proposed new equivalent circuit with TLM for three sizes of pores: macropore, mesopore and micropore. In this model, we defined the ratio ?? of electric double layer parts in whole inner wall of the pore because the inner wall is separated to electrolyte/electrode interface and branch base parts. Calculated electrochemical impedance of blocking electrode shows the lumped constant region in low frequency range and the distributed constant region in low frequency range. General TLM yields the straight line with slope of 45?? in the distributed constant region on the Nyquist plots. In the present analysis, it was found that the slope was 22.5?? at ?? = 0 in the case of double-pores (macropore and mesopore) and 11.25?? at ?? = 0 in the case of triple-pores (macropore, mesopore and micropore). ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Lithium transport in electrode material on the basis of lithium vanadium phosphate (Li3V2(PO4)3) with the NASICON structure was studied by the constant current chronopotentiometry (also called as galvanostatic charge-discharge technique), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and pulse chronoamperometry (PITT). The shape of the cyclic voltammograms of the electrode under study at various potential scan rates and galvanostatic charge-discharge curves at various currents as well as the character of their change during cycling were established. PITT current transients of the Li 3V2(PO4)3 electrode had a characteristic and non-trivial shape, splitting into short, middle, and long-time fragments. The limiting current obtained by means of the zero-moment extrapolation of the short-time j,t fragment does not depend on the lithium concentration in the intercalate, which pointed to its relation to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), whereas the shape of the current transients over the whole temporal scale was strongly influenced by the lithium content in the electrode. By integration of current for each PITT step and subsequent summation of charges the intercalation isotherm of the Li3V 2(PO4)3 electrode was determined. The differential form of the intercalation isotherm is in agreement with the cyclic voltammogram shape at low potential scan rates (??? 0.05 mV s-1). Within the whole j,t-curves of the Li3V2(PO 4)3 electrode the short-time j,t fragments can be located where semi-infinite diffusion conditions are preserved so that the mathematical treatment in the framework of such diffusion type approximation with surface control is justified. The values of the lithium diffusion coefficients (D) were found and the dependence of D on the electrode potential was demonstrated. The lithium diffusion coefficient ranges found by CV and PITT overlap and are within the limits of 10-15-10-12 cm2 s-1. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Electrolyte membranes prepared by blending of sulfonated arylene main-chain polymers like sulfonated PEEK Victrex (sPEEK) or sulfonated PSU Udel (sPSU) with basic polymers like poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) or polybenzimidazole (PBI) show excellent chemical and thermal stability, good proton-conductivity, and good performance in H2 PEM fuel cells. Furthermore, these materials have potentially lower methanol cross-over when compared to standard Nafion-type membranes. In this work, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) have been prepared from such membranes according to the thin-film method. The catalyst layer was spray-coated directly on the heated membrane using an ink consisting of an aqueous suspension of catalyst powder and Nafion solution. Unsupported catalysts were used for anode and cathode. A rather high catalyst loading was chosen in order to minimize the effects of limited catalyst utilization due to flooding conditions at both electrodes.},

The porosity and thickness of the GDL are employed in the analysis as the parameters. In addition, the effects of liquid water and the flow direction of the fuel and air on the performance are also considered in this paper. The results show that both the porosity and thickness of the GDL affect the fuel cell performance significantly, especially the water mass transfer. It is shown that the cell performance with consideration of a liquid water effect is always less than that without consideration of the liquid water effect. In addition, the cell performance with a co-flow pattern of fuel and air is better than that with a counter flow pattern.},

  abstract  = {The current-interrupt technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed in order to study the behavior of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) cathode containing 30 wt \% Nafion and 70 wt \% Pt/C. The steady-state polarization curves were also recorded. The experimental results were analyzed with help of the mathematical models developed in Part I of this paper. The effect of a varying oxygen pressure and humidity on the dynamic response of the cathode was investigated. The double-layer capacitance, Tafel slope, oxygen solubility, a group containing the effective O 2 diffusion coefficient and agglomerate size, and finally, the effective proton conductivity in the cathode were obtained. The parameter values were reasonable and attest the robustness of the agglomerate model for describing the PEFC cathode. At low humidity, a second, low-frequency loop was observed that was attributed to the membrane behavior. {\copyright} 2003 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {A simple two-dimensional model involving kinetics and mass transfer in a PEM fuel cell cathode is presented. In this model, the catalyst layer was simplified as an infinite thin film. The oxygen mass transfer in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) was described using a pure diffusion equation that introduced equivalent oxygen diffusivity. The PEM fuel cell performance under the influence of current collector ribs was investigated. The results show that, the existence of ribs causes the GDL to be used only partly in the mass transfer process. The GDL effectiveness decreases with the cell current density and increases with the width of the gas flow channels. The PEM fuel cell performance decreases with an increase in GDL thickness if the GDL porosity is low. However, when a high-porosity GDL is used, the optimal thickness becomes an indicator determining the maximal PEM fuel cell performance.},

  abstract  = {The problems of diffusive transport to and across an irregular interface are of general interest, but are considered a difficult class of problems for theoretical understanding. In this paper we discuss theory of partial diffusion-limited interfacial transfer/reaction on a realistic fractal interface. The surface irregularity is modeled as a random surface fractal, which is characterized by statistically isotropic self-affine fractals on limited length scales. The power spectrum of roughness of such surface fractal is approximated in terms of power law function for the intermediate wave-numbers (or spatial frequency components in roughness). This description of roughness consists of four fractal morphological characteristic features. Results unravel the connection between the flux/current, surface morphology and its kinetics following a step of surface activity (like a potential step experiment). We show the dependence of reaction flux/current on various fractal roughness characteristics related to power spectrum, and discuss the dynamic crossover of charge transfer controlled regime to fractal morphology controlled diffusion regime to classical inverse square root of time regime. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {We investigate the permeability and selectivity of graphene sheets with designed subnanometer pores using first principles density functional theory calculations. We find high selectivity on the order of 10(8) for H(2)/CH(4) with a high H(2) permeance for a nitrogen-functionalized pore. We find extremely high selectivity on the order of 10(23) for H(2)/CH(4) for an all-hydrogen passivated pore whose small width (at 2.5 A) presents a formidable barrier (1.6 eV) for CH(4) but easily surmountable for H(2) (0.22 eV). These results suggest that these pores are far superior to traditional polymer and silica membranes, where bulk solubility and diffusivity dominate the transport of gas molecules through the material. Recent experimental investigations, using either electron beams or bottom-up synthesis to create pores in graphene, suggest that it may be possible to employ such techniques to engineer variable-sized, graphene nanopores to tune selectivity and molecular diffusivity. Hence, we propose using porous graphene sheets as one-atom-thin, highly efficient, and highly selective membranes for gas separation. Such a pore could have widespread impact on numerous energy and technological applications; including carbon sequestration, fuel cells, and gas sensors.},

  abstract  = {The cross flow from channel to channel through gas diffusion layer (GDL) under the land could play an important role for water removal in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this study, characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL have been investigated experimentally, through measuring unsteady pressure drop in a cell which has the GDL initially wet with liquid water. The thickness of GDL is carefully controlled by inserting various thicknesses of metal shims between the plates. It has been found that severe compression of GDL could result in excessive pressure drop from channel inlet to channel outlet. Removing liquid water from GDL by cross flow is difficult for GDL with high compression levels and for low inlet air flow rates. However, effective water removal can still be achieved at high compression levels of GDL if the inlet air flow rate is high. Based on different compressed GDL thicknesses, different GDL porosities and permeabilities were calculated and their effects on the characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL were evaluated. Visualization of liquid water transport has been conducted by using transparent flow channel, and liquid water removal from GDL under the land was observed for all the tested inlet air flow rates, which confirms that cross flow is practically effective to remove the liquid water accumulated in GDL under the land area.},

The results show that, in NaOH and KOH solutions, the ORR, a quasi-reversible diffusion-controlled reaction, is largely dependent on the electrolyte conditions, and KOH solutions are superior to NaOH solutions for the ORR process in both thermodynamic and kinetic consideration. As the alkaline concentration increases, the ORR performance frustrates, and the protonation of superoxide is suppressed; thus, the ORR shifts from a 2e reduction pathway to a 1e reduction pathway in both solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {When lithium--oxygen batteries discharge, O2 is reduced at the cathode to form solid Li2O2. Understanding the fundamental mechanism of O2 reduction in aprotic solvents is therefore essential to realizing their technological potential. Two different models have been proposed for Li2O2 formation, involving either solution or electrode surface routes. Here, we describe a single unified mechanism, which, unlike previous models, can explain O2 reduction across the whole range of solvents and for which the two previous models are limiting cases. We observe that the solvent influences O2 reduction through its effect on the solubility of LiO2, or, more precisely, the free energy of the reaction LiO2* ⇌ Li(sol)+ + O2$-$(sol) + ion pairs + higher aggregates (clusters). The unified mechanism shows that low-donor-number solvents are likely to lead to premature cell death, and that the future direction of research for lithium--oxygen batteries should focus on the search for new, stable, high-donor-number electrolytes, because they can support higher capacities and can better sustain discharge.},

In addition, the cell discharge capacity increased from 1400 mAh gC -1 at 1 atm of O2 to 2100 mAh gC -1 at 10 atm at 100 ??A cm-2.

This increase in capacity results from a more efficient utilization of the carbon electrode surface at higher pressures. As seen by SEM, the thickness of the discharge product layer was much greater when discharged under higher pressures, indicating more O2 reached the active carbon surfaces and was reduced. In addition, at high pressure the electrode surface was more evenly used, having fewer areas with little or no discharge products. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The composition at 88:12 at. \% (Pd: Ir) showed the highest activity toward ORR at the cathode of the hybrid Li-air battery. The prepared Pd88Ir12/C catalyst showed a current density of -2.58 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V (vs RHE), which was around 30\% higher compared to that of Pd/C (-1.97 mA cm(-2)). When the prepared Pd88Ir12/C catalyst was applied to the hybrid Li-air battery, the polarization of the cell was reduced and the energy efficiency of the cell was about 30\% higher than that of the cell with Pd/C.},

  Abstract                 = {A model of a supercapacitor with pseudocapacitance focusing on effects along the thickness of the electrode was developed. Fast charging, i.e. high power density operation, was analyzed. The occurrence of moving reaction fronts under these conditions is found and discussed. Indicators of the occurrence of moving reaction fronts were defined by analyzing the reaction front velocity and deriving the reaction penetration depth. Effects of the moving reaction fronts on cyclic voltammograms were simulated and an asymmetric broadening of the oxidation peak was found. The influence of the moving reaction fronts on the performance of the supercapacitor was investigated by means of charging energy analysis. Losses were found mainly at the end of the oxidation phase. Partial charging under fast charging conditions reduces the losses. The scale-up of the electrode mass loading and thus the influence of the thickness was analyzed. Simulation results could be used as an {\textquotedblright}operation map{\textquotedblright} to avoid conditions with significant losses.},

  Abstract                 = {The thermodynamic stability of materials can depend on particle size due to the competition between surface and bulk energy. In this Letter, we show that, while sodium peroxide (Na2O2) is the stable bulk phase of Na in an oxygen environment at standard conditions, sodium superoxide (NaO2) is considerably more stable at the nanoscale. As a consequence, the superoxide requires a much lower nucleation energy than the peroxide, explaining why it can be observed as the discharge product in some Na-O2 batteries. As the superoxide can be recharged (decomposed) at much lower overpotentials than the peroxide, these findings are important to create highly reversible Na-O2 batteries. We derive the specific electrochemical conditions to nucleate and retain Na-superoxides and comment on the importance of considering the nanophase thermodynamics when optimizing an electrochemical system.},

  abstract  = {We developed a theory for the anomalous admittance and the constant phase angle behavior of an irregular interface operating under diffusion controlled charge-transfer condition. Interfacial irregularity is modeled as a realistic random fractal, which is characterized as statistically isotropic self-affine fractals on limited length scales. The power spectrum of such a surface fractal is approximated in terms of a power law function for the intermediate wave numbers. This power spectrum has four fractal morphological parameters. They are fractal dimension (DH), lower (l) and upper (L) cutoff length scales of fractality, and the proportionality factor (mu) related to topothesy or strength of roughness. Theoretical result obtained for the admittance on such realistic fractal electrode is an indispensable step in the quantitative description of role of roughness and is applicable for all frequency regimes. This result can also be simplified to three limiting laws for the admittance or impedance. The anomalous admittance/impedance and an approximately constant phase angle behavior is explained through a limiting law for the intermediate frequencies. The intermediate frequency limiting law is dependent on the fractal dimension as well as on the lower cutoff length and strength of roughness. Finally, these results also offer an explanation for difficulties in classical power-law form for the diffusive impedance with incomplete characterization of exponent with fractal morphological parameters.},

  abstract  = {We develop a theory for the electrical admittance of a rough interface under diffusion-limited and partial diffusion-limited charge transfer conditions. The large and small-frequency expansion brings out the relationships between the various morphological features of the rough electrode i.e. area, curvature and width, and the average admittance. The diffusion-limited reaction admittance is determined on an approximately self-affine corrugated random surface fractal. We obtain exact results for the low roughness and the asymptotic results (in three frequency regions) for the arbitrary and large roughness surfaces. These results show an anomalous frequency dependence for the mean admittance and the mean excess admittance for the large and small roughness surfaces, respectively. The intermediate frequency behavior of the reaction admittance for small roughness interfaces has the following form: ???Y??????(i??) 1/2+const.(i??)3/2-H, where H is Hurst's exponent, for the large roughness interfaces it has same form as predicted earlier: ???Y??????(i??)1-H/2. This non-universality and dependence of intermediate-frequency behavior on the strength of interfacial fractality has not been previously conceived. We also show the localization of the active zones in the presence of roughness. Finally, these results unravel the connection between the total reaction admittance and the crossover frequency to the roughness characteristics likes the fractal dimension, lower and upper fractal cutoff lengths, and the amplitude of the fluctuations of the fractal. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The diffusion coefficient of O2 was (1.8$\pm$0.2)$\times$10--6 cm2 s--1 at 25$\deg$C. The activation energy of the diffusion process of O2 was estimated to be 27 kJ mol--1 from the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The solubility of O2 in BMPTFSI was 14 mmol dm--3 at 25$\deg$C and decreased with an increase in temperature. The diffusion coefficient of O was 0.86$\times$10--6 cm2 s--1 at 25$\deg$C. The formal potential of O2/O couple was 1.13 V vs ferrocene/ferrocenium.},

  Abstract                 = {This investigation elucidates the electrochemical reaction process occurring within lithium-sulfur battery cells in detail, which has been unclear even after a half century of study primarily due to the very high reactivity of the polysulfide species. The polysulfide intermediates were deactivated by organic conversion - benzylization, and LC/MS and NMR analyses were first applied. The results demonstrate that the second voltage plateau in the discharge profile, which is the most important step in practical use because of its constant voltage, is dominated by the reduction of the Li2S3 intermediate. The first voltage plateau and the transition state between the plateaus, in which the voltage varies with the capacity, are associated with multiple reactions including the decomposition of S8 into Li2Sx (x = 1 to 7) and the transformation of Li2Sy (y = 4 to 8) into Li2Sz (z = 1 to 3). It is also revealed that longer polysulfide species, Li2Si (i = 6 to 8), are responsible for the redox shuttle phenomenon, which causes serious capacity degradation.},

  abstract = { Room temperature ionic liquids, which have unique properties such as a relatively wide electrochemical stability window and negligible vapor pressure, are promising candidates as electrolytes for developing lithium–air batteries with enhanced performance. The local current density, a crucial parameter in determining the performance of lithium–air batteries, is directly proportional to the rate constant of the electron transfer reaction at the surface of the anode that involves the oxidation of pure lithium metal into lithium ion (Li+). The electrochemical properties of ionic liquid based electrolytes, which can be molecularly tailored on the basis of the structure of their constituent cations and anions, play a crucial role in determining the reaction rate at the anode. In this paper, we present a novel approach, based on Marcus theory, to evaluate the effect of varying length of the alkyl side chain of model imidazolium based cations on the rates of electron transfer reaction at the anode. Density functional theory was employed for calculating the necessary free energies for intermediate reactions. Our results indicate that the magnitude of the Gibbs free energy of the overall reaction decreases linearly with the inverse of the static dielectric constant of the ionic liquid, which in turn corresponds with an increase in the length of the alkyl side chain of the ionic liquid cation. Nelsen’s four-point method was employed to evaluate the inner sphere reorganization energy. The total reorganization energy decreases with increase in the length of the alkyl side chain. Finally, the rate constants for the anodic electron transfer reaction were calculated in the presence of varying ionic liquid based electrolytes. The overall rate constant for electron transfer increases with increase in the static dielectric constant. The presented results provide important insight into identification of appropriate ionic liquid electrolytes to obtain enhanced current densities in lithium–air batteries. },

  Abstract                 = {Most Li-O2 batteries suffer from sluggish kinetics during oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). To overcome this drawback, we take the lesson from other catalysis researches that showed improved catalytic activities by employing metal alloy catalysts. Such research effort has led us to find Pt3Co nanoparticles as an effective OER catalyst in Li-O2 batteries. The superior catalytic activity was reflected in the substantially decreased overpotentials and improved cycling/rate performance compared to those of other catalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the low OER overpotentials are associated with the reduced adsorption strength of LiO2 on the outermost Pt catalytic sites. Also, the alloy catalyst generates amorphous Li2O2 conformally coated around the catalyst and thus facilitates easier decomposition and higher reversibility. This investigation conveys an important message that understanding elementary reactions and surface charge engineering of air-catalysts are one of the most effective approaches in resolving the chronic sluggish charging kinetics in Li-O2 batteries.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel approach to tuning electrochemical rectification using 2D assemblies of quantum dots (QDs) is presented. Asymmetric enhancement of the oxidation and reduction currents in the presence of the Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) redox couple is observed upon adsorption of QDs at thiol-modified Au electrodes. The extent of the electrochemical rectification is dependent on the average QD size. A molecular blocking layer is generated by self-assembling 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and an ultrathin film of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) on the electrode. The polycationic film allows the electrostatic adsorption of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-stabilized CdTe QDs, generating 2D assemblies with approximately 0.4% coverage. The QD adsorption activates a fast charge transfer across the blocking layer in which the reduction process is more strongly enhanced than the oxidation reaction. The partial electrochemical rectification is rationalized in terms of the relative position of the valence (VB) and conduction band (CB) edges with respect to the redox Fermi energy ({$\epsilon$}(redox)). Quantitative analysis of the exchange current density obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates that the enhancement of charge transport across the molecular barrier is strongly dependent on the position of the QD valence band edge relative to {$\epsilon$}(redox). The average electron tunneling rate constant through the QD assemblies is estimated on the basis of the Gerischer model for electron transfer.},

  abstract  = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for lithium ion batteries has recently gained increasing attention due to its ability of non-invasive evaluation of important electrochemical parameters. Commonly used three-electrode test cells, however, proved unreliable due to asymmetric current line distributions, causing severe distortions of impedance spectra. Finite element method (FEM) simulations can visualize these current lines at different frequencies and simulate impedance spectra at given geometries. By applying FEM simulations to a recently developed coaxial impedance test cell, limiting conditions for reliable impedance measurements could be identified. Using a reference electrode in coaxial position yields sufficiently reliable results as long as the electrode misalignment is small compared to the electrolyte thickness and edge effects are prevented. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {The formation of nonelectroactive self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) at the electrode/electrolyte interface was characterized with simultaneous impedance, gravimetric, and direct current measurements. In the presence of specifically adsorbing inorganic ions, this provides key information about the formation of SAMs. Gravimetric measurements allow an estimation of the adsorbate surface coverage; and completion of the assembly process can then be monitored in real-time. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements play a multifunctional role: they enable elucidation of the physical models of the interface, provide the information about the effective capacitance of SAMs thus probing the dielectric properties of the adsorbed layers, and evaluate the ability of charged electrolyte components to approach the electrode surface through the SAM (using adsorbing/desorbing SO4(2-) as an electroactive probe). The latter is important to assess the extent of defects in the formed organic layers. Finally, monitoring the direct current during SAM formation together with the collected gravimetric data can give additional important information about the process. A series of n-mercaptoalcohols with different hydrocarbon chain length adsorbing at Au electrodes was used as the model object to evaluate the proposed approach.},

It is confirmed that the pore-size distribution of the diffusion layer is a more critical parameter for mass-transport processes within the electrode and for cell performance characteristics than the total porosity itself. Data obtained from mercury intrusion porosimetry, single-cell performance tests and ac impedance analyses indicate that the performance loss due to mass-transport limitations can be reduced by enlarging the macropore volume in the diffusion layer. The water flooding problem is discussed in terms of condensation phenomena which are dependent on pore-size.},

The MD simulated values of Di,self are compared with estimations of the commonly used Bosanquet formula 1/Di,self=1/Di,Kn+1/{\DH}ii,fl, that combines molecule--wall and molecule--molecule interactions:, where Di,Kn is the Knudsen diffusivity, and {\DH}ii,fl is the self-diffusivity of species i in the fluid phase at the same molar concentration, ci, as within the mesopores. For components with poor adsorption strength, such as H2, the MD simulated Di,self values are in good agreement with the estimations using the Bosanquet formula for the whole range of pore concentrations. For components with strong adsorption at the pore walls, the MD simulated values are significantly lower than the Bosanquet estimations when molecule--wall interactions are dominant. These deviations are traceable to the failure of the Knudsen prescription of diffuse reflectance on molecule--wall collisions, because adsorption at the pore walls introduces a bias in the molecular hops. For any given molecule, the Bosanquet estimations tend to be increasingly accurate when the pore diameters are increased.},

  Abstract                 = {Synthetic active carbons obtained via controlled carbonization of phenolic resins were characterized using low temperature nitrogen adsorption over a wide pressure range. It was shown that, although active carbons under study show appreciable differences in the BET specific surface area and the total pore volume, they exhibit quite similar porous properties. All samples were shown to possess a considerable amount of small micropores (ca. 0.7 nm). However, the active carbons have markedly different amounts of larger micropores (width above ca. 1 nm) and mesopores. It was shown that simple comparative methods, such as the high resolution alphas plot, provide valuable information about structural properties of active carbons. However, reliable adsorption data for suitable reference adsorbents need to be available in order to successfully apply the comparative methods. Therefore, a nitrogen adsorption isotherm was measured on a Cabot BP 280 nongraphitized carbon black over a relative pressure range from 10(-6) to 0.99 and the resulting data (104 points) are reported in a tabular form. In the high pressure region (relative pressure from 0.1 to 0.7), the isotherm for the BP 280 sample exhibits a good agreement with the reference data available in the literature. Moreover, the adsorption isotherm currently reported covers the low pressure range, which is crucial in profound characterization of porous and nonporous solids by means of comparative methods of adsorption analysis.},

The modification of graphene/graphene oxide and the utilization of these materials in the fabrication of nanocomposites with different polymer matrixes have been explored. Different organic polymers have been used to fabricate graphene filled polymer nanocomposites by a range of methods. In the case of modified graphene-based polymer nanocomposites, the percolation threshold can be achieved at a very lower filler loading.

The solution is valid at a low current density, when the proton and oxygen transport losses in the CCL are not large. The zero-frequency resistance contains the faradaic term, the terms due to the proton and oxygen transport in the CCL and due to the oxygen transport in the GDL. The analytical equation for Z is fast enough for least-squares fitting of experimental spectra, which yields the GDL oxygen diffusivity, the Tafel slope of the oxygen reduction reaction, and the CCL proton conductivity and oxygen diffusivity. As an example, the model is fitted to three measured spectra of a high-temperature PEMFC; the fitting parameters are discussed.},

Ag particles of average size of 4.7 nm were uniformly distributed on the RGO sheets. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is studied on Ag-RGO catalyst in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes by using cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode techniques. As the interest in non-aqueous electrolyte is to study the catalytic performance of Ag-RGO for rechargeable Li-O2 cells, these cells are assembled and characterized. Li-O2 cells with Ag-RGO as the oxygen electrode catalyst are subjected to charge-discharge cycling at several current densities. A discharge capacity of 11\hspace{0.167em}950 mA h g(-1) (11.29 mA h cm(-2)) is obtained initially at low current density. Although there is a decrease in the capacity on repeated discharge-charge cycling initially, a stable capacity is observed for about 30 cycles. The results indicate that Ag-RGO is a suitable catalyst for rechargeable Li-O2 cells.},

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical treatment of a Schottky barrier dynamic response is developed on the basis of a general model of a semiconductor with thickness comparable in length to the space charge region width. It is shown that, when the space charge region approaches the metal/semiconductor interface, the electric field at this interface, induced by the charge accumulated on the metal, becomes significant with respect to the electric field induced by the charge accumulated on the semiconductor. Under this condition, the total capacitance of the Schottky barrier becomes independent of the polarization potential and tends to the value {$\epsilon$}/L, like in a pure dielectric insulator. The term thin film is intended to be with respect to the screening length, which is a function of the volumetric charge density. In amorphous materials the transition potential at which the semiconducting to insulating behaviour is observed is dependent on the frequency. An approximated analytical solution for the capacitance of the junction is calculated. The model for finite thickness semiconductors is successfully applied to the study of anodic Nb(2)O(5), formed in phosphate buffer 0.5 M aqueous solution up to different formation potentials (namely 5, 10 and 20 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The finite thickness semiconductor model permits extrapolation to a general behaviour of the oxide in a wide range of frequencies, potentials and thicknesses, and identification of the electron transfer between adsorbed surface species and the conduction band of Nb(2)O(5) at potentials near to the flat band value.},

These and other experimental deviations have hitherto been tentatively attributed to differences of the force constants of the oxidized and reduced species. Accordingly, we report application of the asymmetric form of Marcus theory to the voltammetric study of the kinetics of electrode reactions. The resulting four-parameter model accounts for discrepancies in the values of the inner-shell force constants and offers deeper insight to the changes involved in electron transfer processes at electrodes. The variation of the electrochemical rate constant with the applied potential is examined, and seen to be in agreement with reported experimental deviations from the simple MH model. The application of the asymmetric model to cyclic and square wave voltammetries is further reported.},

  Abstract                 = {The electrolyte role in non-aqueous lithium/air batteries is attracting a lot of attention in several research groups, because of its fundamental importance in producing the appropriate reversible electrochemical reduction. While recent published works identify the lithium superoxide as the main degrading agent for propylene carbonate (PC), there is no clear experimental evidence that the oxygen at the cathode interface layer does not reduce further to peroxide before reacting with PC. Here, we investigate the reactivity of lithium peroxide versus propylene carbonate and find that Li(2)O(2) irreversibly decomposes the carbonate solvent, leading to alkyl carbonates. We also show that, compared with a single Li(2)O(2) unit in PC, a crystalline surface of Li(2)O(2) exhibits an enhanced reactivity. Our findings support the possibility that in lithium/air cells, oxygen may still be reduced to peroxide, with the formation of solid Li(2)O(2), which degrades by decomposing PC.},

Within the vicinity of the chemical potential $\Delta$G \~{} 0.20 eV/Li from the thermodynamic ground state of the Li2O2 crystal structure (i.e., F\"{o}ppl structure), all of these newly found metastable Li2O2 crystal structures are found to be insulating and high-k materials, and they have a common unique signature of an O22$-$ O-O vibration mode ($\omega$ \~{} 799--865 cm$-$1), which is in the range of that commonly observed in Li-air battery experiments, regardless of the random O22$-$ orientations and the symmetry in the crystal lattice. From XRD patterns analysis, the commercially available Li2O2 powder is confirmed to be the thermodynamic ground state F\"{o}ppl-like structure. However, for Li2O2 compounds that are grown electrochemically under the environment of Li-O2 cells, we found that the XRD patterns alone are not sufficient for structural identification of these metastable Li2O2 crystalline phases due to the poor crystallinity of the sample. In addition, the commonly known Raman signal of O22$-$ vibration mode is also found to be insufficient to validate the possible existence of these newly predicted Li2O2 crystal structures, as all of them similarly share the similar O22$-$ vibration mode. However considering that the discharge voltage in most Li-O2 cells are typically several tenths of an eV below the thermodynamic equilibrium for the formation of ground state F\"{o}ppl structure, the formation of these metastable Li2O2 crystal structures appears to be thermodynamically feasible.},

The gas diffusion layer was prepared by rolling, spraying, and screen printing methods, and Nafion solution was impregnated using spraying and brushing methods. The diffusion layer in a PEMFC consists of a thin layer of carbon black mixed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) that is coated onto a sheet of macro-porous carbon backing cloth. The effects of different fabrication methods and thicknesses of gas diffusion layer are discussed in the light of porosimetry and I--V polarization curves and variables related to the electrode analyzed by numerical simulation. The spraying method proved to be more profitable for cell performance than the brushing method for the impregnation of Nafion solution because it reduced the charge transfer resistance and extended the three-phase region. The goals of this work are to find the optimum thickness of the gas diffusion layer and to undertake an analysis of the system.},

Cation-disordered materials are generally disregarded as cathodes because lithium diffusion tends to be limited by their structures. The performance of Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 shows that lithium diffusion can be facile in disordered materials. Using ab initio computations, we demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is due to percolation of certain diffusion channels that are active in disordered structures, but is unique to Li excess materials. This leads to a unified understanding of high performance in both layered and Li excess materials, and opens up an exciting new direction for designing disordered electrode materials with high capacity and high energy density.},

Much research has focused on increasing the power output of lithium batteries by reducing lithium-ion diffusion distances, but outputs remain far below those of electrochemical capacitors and below the levels required for many applications. Here, we report an alternative approach based on the redox reactions of functional groups on the surfaces of carbon nanotubes. Layer-by-layer techniques are used to assemble an electrode that consists of additive-free, densely packed and functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The electrode, which is several micrometres thick, can store lithium up to a reversible gravimetric capacity of approximately 200 mA h g(-1)(electrode) while also delivering 100 kW kg(electrode)(-1) of power and providing lifetimes in excess of thousands of cycles, both of which are comparable to electrochemical capacitor electrodes. A device using the nanotube electrode as the positive electrode and lithium titanium oxide as a negative electrode had a gravimetric energy approximately 5 times higher than conventional electrochemical capacitors and power delivery approximately 10 times higher than conventional lithium-ion batteries.},

Three types of gas diffusion layers were studied at 202 kPa and 353$\deg$K. An optimum bolt torque was observed when ELAT{\textregistered} or a combination of CARBEL{\textregistered} and TORAY{\texttrademark} gas diffusion media were used as diffusion layers. The optimum is related to the gasket thickness and the measured compression pressure on the diffusion layer. The performance changes may also be related to changes in the porosity, the electrical contact resistance, and the excluded water at the membrane.},

  abstract  = {The effect of sublayers on the deposited platinum (Pt) catalyst layer fabricated by electrodeposition, and on the resulting fuel cell performance, was investigated. The substrate was prepared by applying a hydrophobic sublayer, composed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon black, and a hydrophilic sublayer, composed of Nafion and glycerol, onto an uncatalyzed gas diffusion layer prior to the electrodeposition of the Pt catalyst. The hydrophilic sublayer was found to play a substantial role in the Pt electrodeposition, since the structure of the resultant Pt catalyst significantly depended on the presence of the{~}hydrophilic sublayer, the total loading amount and the Nafion to glycerol weight ratio, which in turn affected the fuel cell performance. The hydrophobic sublayer, which did not directly contact with the plating solution, did not show as marked an effect on the Pt deposit structure compared to that of the hydrophilic sublayer, except at high PTFE to carbon black weight ratios ($\geq$70:30). However, the suitable PTFE to carbon black weight ratio in the hydrophobic sublayer was still important for the water management, mass transport of reactant gases and ohmic resistance of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) during fuel cell operation. In this study, a total hydrophilic loading of 0.8{~}mg{~}cm$-$2 with a Nafion to glycerol weight ratio of 50:50, and a PTFE to carbon black weight ratio in the hydrophobic sublayer of 30:70 was found to yield the best Pt catalyst layer for PEMFC.},

  Abstract                 = {A multi-nuclear solid-state NMR approach is employed to investigate the lithium-air battery, to monitor the evolution of the electrochemical products formed during cycling, and to gain insight into processes affecting capacity fading. While lithium peroxide is identified by (17)O solid state NMR (ssNMR) as the predominant product in the first discharge in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolytes, it reacts with the carbon cathode surface to form carbonate during the charging process. (13)C ssNMR provides evidence for carbonate formation on the surface of the carbon cathode, the carbonate being removed at high charging voltages in the first cycle, but accumulating in later cycles. Small amounts of lithium hydroxide and formate are also detected in discharged cathodes and while the hydroxide formation is reversible, the formate persists and accumulates in the cathode upon further cycling. The results indicate that the rechargeability of the battery is limited by both the electrolyte and the carbon cathode stability. The utility of ssNMR spectroscopy in directly detecting product formation and decomposition within the battery is demonstrated, a necessary step in the assessment of new electrolytes, catalysts, and cathode materials for the development of a viable lithium-oxygen battery.},

Based on the physical reliability of the fitting parameters, the parallel diffusion path model was seen to describe adequately the EIS and PITT responses obtained from thin, non-uniform composite electrodes (graphite is considered as an example). Some important issues related to impedance modeling (exemplified by comparison of the properties of serial and parallel combinations of distributed diffusion elements) are discussed. We show that dlog|Id(t)|/dlog t vs. t/??d plots are very useful for diagnosing the type of non-uniformity (particle size distribution, PSD) of intercalation electrodes. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Each rod follows a trajectory which is described by a generalized random function and when two rods collide they interchange velocities (and trajectories). An exact solution is obtained for the distribution fs(x,v,tv$\prime$) which is the probability of finding a particle at x with velocity v at time t that was at x=0 with velocity v$\prime$ at t=0. The most interesting result is that in the long-time limit p(x,t), which is the probability of finding a particle at x at time t that was at x=0 at t=0, is of the form t$-$14exp($-$x2t12). Thus, the spatial distribution does not become Gaussian and Fick's law is not valid. It is suggested that this qualitative behavior might be expected whenever single-file effects become important and that it is not dependent on the details of the one-dimensional hard-rod collisions which have been used in the derivation.},

It was found that extensive work has been carried out on the issues of flooding during the last two decades, including prediction through numerical modeling, detection by experimental measurements, and mitigation through the design of cell components and manipulating the operating conditions. Two classes of strategies to mitigate flooding have been developed. The first is based on system design and engineering, which is often accompanied by significant parasitic power loss. The second class is based on membrane electrode assembly (MEA) design and engineering, and involves modifying the material and structural properties of the gas diffusion layer (GDL), cathode catalyst layer (CCL) and membrane to function in the presence of liquid water. In this review, several insightful directions are also suggested for future investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrochemical degradation on silicon (Si) anodes prevents them from being successfully used in lithium (Li)-ion battery full cells. Unlike the case of graphite anodes, the natural solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films generated from carbonate electrolytes do not self-passivate on Si, causing continuous electrolyte decomposition and loss of Li ions. In this work, we aim at solving the issue of electrochemical degradation by fabricating artificial SEI films using a solid electrolyte material, lithium phosphorus oxynitride (Lipon), which conducts Li ions and blocks electrons. For Si anodes coated with Lipon of 50 nm or thicker, a significant effect is observed in suppressing electrolyte decomposition, while Lipon of thinner than 40 nm has a limited effect. Ionic and electronic conductivity measurements reveal that the artificial SEI is effective when it is a pure ionic conductor, but electrolyte decomposition is only partially suppressed when the artificial SEI is a mixed electronic-ionic conductor. The critical thickness for this transition in conducting behavior is found to be 40-50 nm. This work provides guidance for designing artificial SEI films for high-capacity Li-ion battery electrodes using solid electrolyte materials.},

The electrolyte is forced to recirculate through the cathode and then saturated with oxygen in a tank external to the battery. The forced convection enhances oxygen transport and alleviates the problem of electrode blockage during discharge. A two dimensional, transient, non-isothermal simulation model is developed to study the heat and mass transfer within the battery and validate the proposed design. Results show that this novel active cathode design improves the battery capacity at all discharge current densities. The capacity of the Li--O2 battery is increased by 15.5 times (from 12.2{~}mAh{~}g$-$1 to 201{~}mAh{~}g$-$1) at the discharge current of 2.0{~}mA{~}cm$-$2 when a conventional passive electrode is replaced by the newly designed active electrode. Furthermore, a cathode with non-uniform porosity is suggested and simulation results show that it can reach a higher discharge capacity without decreasing its power density. Detailed mass transport processes in the battery are also studied.},

  Abstract                 = {Many battery electrodes contain ensembles of nanoparticles that phase-separate on (de)intercalation. In such electrodes, the fraction of actively intercalating particles directly impacts cycle life: a vanishing population concentrates the current in a small number of particles, leading to current hotspots. Reports of the active particle population in the phase-separating electrode lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4; LFP) vary widely, ranging from near 0% (particle-by-particle) to 100% (concurrent intercalation). Using synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy, we probed the individual state-of-charge for over 3,000 LFP particles. We observed that the active population depends strongly on the cycling current, exhibiting particle-by-particle-like behaviour at low rates and increasingly concurrent behaviour at high rates, consistent with our phase-field porous electrode simulations. Contrary to intuition, the current density, or current per active internal surface area, is nearly invariant with the global electrode cycling rate. Rather, the electrode accommodates higher current by increasing the active particle population. This behaviour results from thermodynamic transformation barriers in LFP, and such a phenomenon probably extends to other phase-separating battery materials. We propose that modifying the transformation barrier and exchange current density can increase the active population and thus the current homogeneity. This could introduce new paradigms to enhance the cycle life of phase-separating battery electrodes.},

  abstract  = {Sparsely populated, vertically aligned nitrogen doped carbon nanotube arrays (CNTAs) with dislocated-graphene stacking were grown directly on carbon fiber papers and investigated as hierarchical air cathodes in hybrid Li-air batteries with aqueous catholytes. The CNTAs were made with electrodeposited Ni nanocatalysts, followed by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The thus obtained CNTAs can reach a population number density as low as 107 per cm2 on the carbon fibers, achieving an extremely high porosity of over 99\% for the active layer in the cathode. The sparse CNTAs not only provide effective pathways for the reacting species, but also show a significantly high catalytic activity, which is found to be comparable to that of a supported Pt electrocatalyst. The high activity of the CNTAs is attributed to the rich graphene edges exposed on the CNT surface and nitrogen doping. Hybrid Li-air batteries with such cathodes have shown a consistent discharging capacity of 710 mA h g$-$1 and a specific energy of 2057 W h kg$-$1 at 0.5 mA cm$-$2. Stable charge--discharge cycling at 0.5 mA cm$-$2 showed an average potential difference of 1.35 V, indicative of a relatively small overpotential and high round trip efficiency (71\%). Furthermore, the hybrid Li-air battery based on the hierarchical cathode can reach a power density as high as 10.4 mW cm$-$2.},

To fabricate an anode, the inks were sprayed onto the gas diffusion backing electrode, consisting of microporous layer (MPL) and carbon paper. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the cross-sectional morphology of the anode catalyst layers revealed that the layers fabricated by ultrasonicating the catalyst in DI or IPA, ball-milling in DI and ball-milling in IPA consisted of granular-shaped, granular+flake-shaped and flake-shaped agglomerates, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {Lithium-oxygen chemistry offers the highest energy density for a rechargeable system as a "lithium-air battery". Most studies of lithium-air batteries have focused on demonstrating battery operations in pure oxygen conditions; such a battery should technically be described as a "lithium-dioxygen battery". Consequently, the next step for the lithium-"air" battery is to understand how the reaction chemistry is affected by the constituents of ambient air. Among the components of air, CO2 is of particular interest because of its high solubility in organic solvents and it can react actively with O2(-[sup]), which is the key intermediate species in Li-O2 battery reactions. In this work, we investigated the reaction mechanisms in the Li-O2/CO2 cell under various electrolyte conditions using quantum mechanical simulations combined with experimental verification. Our most important finding is that the subtle balance among various reaction pathways influencing the potential energy surfaces can be modified by the electrolyte solvation effect. Thus, a low dielectric electrolyte tends to primarily form Li2O2, while a high dielectric electrolyte is effective in electrochemically activating CO2, yielding only Li2CO3. Most surprisingly, we further discovered that a high dielectric medium such as DMSO can result in the reversible reaction of Li2CO3 over multiple cycles. We believe that the current mechanistic understanding of the chemistry of CO2 in a Li-air cell and the interplay of CO2 with electrolyte solvation will provide an important guideline for developing Li-air batteries. Furthermore, the possibility for a rechargeable Li-O2/CO2 battery based on Li2CO3 may have merits in enhancing cyclability by minimizing side reactions.},

Transient image intensity data is correlated to the liquid surface height and is analyzed and presented in the form of three-dimensional reconstructions of the time-evolving gas/liquid interface inside the fibrous structure. The high spatial resolution of the visualization can resolve the dynamic transport of liquid water through distinct pathways, which helps to refine understanding regarding liquid water transport mechanism within these porous layers. The physical observations suggest that the water is not transported via a converging capillary tree as suggested in prior work and models. Rather, transport is dominated by fingering and channeling. Based on the physical insight obtained from the experiments, a new water transport scheme is proposed as the basis for developing improved models for water transport in hydrophobic gas diffusion layers.},

The unique properties of faceted photocatalysts are discussed in relation to anisotropic corrosion, interaction dependence of adsorbates, photocatalytic selectivity, photo-reduction and oxidation sites, and photocatalytic reaction order. Ideas for future research on crystal facet engineering for improving the performance of photocatalysts are also proposed.},

  abstract  = {Developing high-performance batteries relies on material breakthroughs. During the past few years, various in situ characterization tools have been developed and have become indispensible in studying and the eventual optimization of battery materials. However, soft X-ray spectroscopy, one of the most sensitive probes of electronic states, has been mainly limited to ex situ experiments for battery research. Here we achieve in situ and operando soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy of lithium-ion battery cathodes. Taking advantage of the elemental, chemical and surface sensitivities of soft X-rays, we discover distinct lithium-ion and electron dynamics in Li(Co({\^{A}}\textsuperscript{1}/{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$f$)Ni({\^{A}}\textsuperscript{1}/{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$f$)Mn({\^{A}}\textsuperscript{1}/{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$f$))O{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase} and LiFePO{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotedblbase} cathodes in polymer electrolytes. The contrast between the two systems and the relaxation effect in LiFePO{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotedblbase} is attributed to a phase transformation mechanism, and the mesoscale morphology and charge conductivity of the electrodes. These discoveries demonstrate feasibility and power of in situ soft X-ray spectroscopy for studying integrated and dynamic effects in batteries.},

One central question critical to device performance is how the mobile ions accumulate near charged electrodes. Here, we present the excess ion depth profiles of ILs in ionomer membrane actuators (Aquivion/1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride (BMMI-Cl), 27 $\mu$m thick), characterized directly by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) at liquid nitrogen temperature. Experimental results reveal that for the IL studied, cations and anions are accumulated at both electrodes. The large difference in the total volume occupied by the excess ions between the two electrodes cause the observed large bending actuation of the actuator. Hence we demonstrate that ToF-SIMS experiment provides great insights on the physics nature of ionic devices.},

In order to compare the results obtained with this titanium PBI-based composite membrane, a standard PBI membrane, a PBI membrane prepared by a direct doping and casting method with TFA and a sulphonated PBI membrane were prepared. The membranes were physico-chemically and electrochemically characterised for use as electrolytes in high-temperature PEMFCs. All of the membranes were cast from the same polymer with the same molecular weight. The sulphonated and the composite membranes with TiO2 reached the highest doping levels under the same conditions. The sulphonated PBI membrane showed the highest conductivity at 125$\deg$C (0.18Scm$-$1). Only the composite membrane with TiO2 retained high conductivity values at the higher temperatures and this is a result of its high doping level and high water retention capacity. The TiO2--PBI composite membrane showed the best performance and achieved a power density of 800mWcm$-$1 at 150$\deg$C. The results suggest that TiO2/PBI-based composite membranes are promising electrolytes for high temperature PEMFCs.},

  abstract  = {New test equipment and characterization methods for aging investigations on lithium-ion cells for automotive applications are presented in this work. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a well-established method for cell characterization and analyzing electrochemical processes. In order to integrate this method into long-term aging studies with real driving currents, new test equipment is mandatory. The presented test equipment meets the demands for high current, wide bandwidth and precise measurement. This allows the cells to be cycled and characterized without interruption for changing the test device. The characterization procedures must be of short duration and have a minimum charge-throughput for negligible influence on the aging effect. This work presents new methods in the time and the frequency domain for obtaining the impedance spectrum which allow a flexible trade-off between measurement performance, time consumption and charge-throughput. In addition to sinusoidal waveforms, rectangular, Gaussian and sin(x)/x pulses are applied for EIS. The performance of the different methods is discussed. Finally, the time domain analysis is applied with real driving currents which provides impedance spectra for state of charge estimation considering aging effects in the car.},

The active sites on cathode surfaces and their role in electrochemical reactions in aprotic lithium-oxygen cells are difficult to ascertain because the exact nature of the sites is unknown. Here we report the deposition of subnanometre silver clusters of exact size and number of atoms on passivated carbon to study the discharge process in lithium-oxygen cells. The results reveal dramatically different morphologies of the electrochemically grown lithium peroxide dependent on the size of the clusters. This dependence is found to be due to the influence of the cluster size on the formation mechanism, which also affects the charge process. The results of this study suggest that precise control of subnanometre surface structure on cathodes can be used as a means to improve the performance of lithium-oxygen cells.},

  abstract  = {Nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries have a much superior theoretical gravimetric energy density compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries, and thus could render long-range electric vehicles a reality. A molecular-level understanding of the reversible formation of lithium peroxide in these batteries, the properties of major/minor discharge products, and the stability of the nonaqueous electrolytes is required to achieve successful lithium-oxygen batteries. We demonstrate that the major discharge product formed in the lithium-oxygen cell, lithium peroxide, exhibits a magnetic moment. These results are based on dc-magnetization measurements and a lithium-oxygen cell containing an ether-based electrolyte. The results are unexpected because bulk lithium peroxide has a significant band gap. Density functional calculations predict that superoxide-type surface oxygen groups with unpaired electrons exist on stoichiometric lithium peroxide crystalline surfaces and on nanoparticle surfaces; these computational results are consistent with the magnetic measurement of the discharged lithium peroxide product as well as EPR measurements on commercial lithium peroxide. The presence of superoxide-type surface oxygen groups with spin can play a role in the reversible formation and decomposition of lithium peroxide as well as the reversible formation and decomposition of electrolyte molecules.},

  abstract  = {$\alpha$-MnO2 nanowires modified with dispersed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-protected Au and Ag nanoclusters (Au-MnO2 and Ag-MnO2) were used for the first time as hybrid oxygen electrocatalysts for nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries. The Au-MnO2 and Ag-MnO2 hybrid catalysts surpassed the performance of pristine $\alpha$-MnO2 nanowires in full-cell tests in the following order: Au-MnO2  Ag-MnO2  pristine $\alpha$-MnO2. Specifically cells with the Au-MnO2 catalyst could reduce the discharge/charge overpotentials at 100 mA g-1 to 0.23/1.02 V and deliver discharge/charge capacities of 5784/5020 mAh g-1. They could also be cycled for at least 60 times at the depth of discharge (DOD) of 1000 mAh g-1. The good full cell performance demonstrated the effectiveness of Au/Ag nanoclusters in promoting oxygen electrocatalysis on $\alpha$-MnO2; forming discharge products with more reactive morphologies. It is therefore worthwhile to explore the use of Au and Ag nanoclusters in other catalyst systems for oxygen electrocatalysis in nonaqueous solution.},

PP-based electrolytes were found to be more conductive and substantially more efficient in suppressing dendrite formation on cycled lithium anodes; as little as 11{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\ldots}wt{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textperthousand}\% PP-IL in a PC-LiTFSI host produces more than a ten-fold increase in cell lifetime. Both PP- and IM-based nanoparticle hybrid electrolytes provide up to 10{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textperthousand}000-fold improvements in cell lifetime than anticipated based on their mechanical modulus alone. Galvanostatic cycling measurements in Li/Li4 Ti5 O12 half cells using IL-nanoparticle hybrid electrolytes reveal more than 500{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\ldots}cycles of trouble-free operation and enhanced rate capability.},

  abstract  = {PtAu nanoparticles (NPs) were shown to strongly enhance the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable Li-O(2) cells. Li-O(2) cells with PtAu/C were found to exhibit the highest round-trip efficiency reported to date. During ORR via xLi(+) + O(2) + xe(-) --> Li(x)O(2), the discharge voltage with PtAu/C was considerably higher than that of pure carbon and comparable to that of Au/C. During OER via Li(x)O(2) --> xLi(+) + O(2) + xe(-), the charge voltages with PtAu/C fell in the range from 3.4 to 3.8 V(Li), which is slightly lower than obtained with Pt. It is hypothesized that PtAu NPs exhibit bifunctional catalytic activity, having surface Au and Pt atoms primarily responsible for ORR and OER kinetics in Li-O(2) cells, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The lack of fundamental understanding of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution in nonaqueous electrolytes significantly hinders the development of rechargeable lithium-air batteries. Here we employ a solid-state Li(4+x)Ti(5)O(12)/LiPON/Li(x)V(2)O(5) cell and examine in situ the chemistry of Li-O(2) reaction products on Li(x)V(2)O(5) as a function of applied voltage under ultra high vacuum (UHV) and at 500 mtorr of oxygen pressure using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS). Under UHV, lithium intercalated into Li(x)V(2)O(5) while molecular oxygen was reduced to form lithium peroxide on Li(x)V(2)O(5) in the presence of oxygen upon discharge. Interestingly, the oxidation of Li(2)O(2) began at much lower overpotentials (\~{}240 mV) than the charge overpotentials of conventional Li-O(2) cells with aprotic electrolytes (\~{}1000 mV). Our study provides the first evidence of reversible lithium peroxide formation and decomposition in situ on an oxide surface using a solid-state cell, and new insights into the reaction mechanism of Li-O(2) chemistry.},

  abstract  = {The zinc air fuel cell (ZAFC) is a promising candidate for electrical energy storage and electric vehicle propulsion. However, its limited durability has become a major obstacle for its successful commercialization. In this study, 2-cell stacks, 25{~}cm\textsuperscript{2} cells and three-electrode half-cells are constructed to experimentally investigate the degradation characteristics of the air cathode. The results of electrochemical tests reveal that the peak power density for the 25{~}cm2 cell with a new air cathode is 454{~}mW{~}cm$-$2, which is twice as the value of the used air cathode. The electrochemical impedance analysis shows that both the charge transfer resistance and the mass transfer resistance of the used air cathodes have increased, suggesting that the catalyst surface area and gas diffusion coefficient have decreased significantly. Additionally, the microstructure and morphology of the catalytic layer (CL) and gas diffusion layer (GDL) are characterized by scanning electron microscopes (SEM). SEM results confirm that the micropores in CL and GDL of the used air cathode are seriously clogged, and many catalyst particles are lost. Therefore, the performance degradation is mainly due to the clogging of micropores and loss of catalyst particles. Furthermore, hypotheses of degradation mechanism and mitigation strategies for GDL and CL are discussed briefly.},

  Abstract                 = {Several important ambiguities in immittance spectroscopy (IS) model data-fitting results are identified and illustrated by means of complex-nonlinear-least-squares (CNLS) fits of experimental and synthetic frequency response data. A well-known intrinsic ambiguity, following from Maxwell's electromagnetic equations, arises from the indistinguishability in external measurements of conduction and displacement currents. Usual fit models for either dielectric or conductive-system situations, such as the Davidson-Cole one, only involve a strength parameter, a dielectric constant, a characteristic relaxation time, and a fractional exponent and lead to no additional ambiguities. But the situation is different for more powerful and useful general models, such as ordinary or anomalous diffusion Poisson-Nernst-Planck ones: PNP and PNPA, used here, whose historical background, current status, and applicability are described and discussed herein. They apply to two different kinds of experimental IS situations and involve several additional, potentially free fit parameters, such as the mobilities of positive and negative charge carriers, and generation-recombination parameters that determine the partial or complete dissociation of a neutral entity of concentration N(0) into positive and negative charge carriers of equal concentration, c(0). Then, several additional ambiguities appear that may require information about the material system involved for their adequate resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Consequences of the well-known Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) continuum equations of charge motion in liquids or solids for ordinary or anomalous diffusion are investigated for an electrochemical cell with completely blocking electrodes. Previous work is summarized and much of it is shown to be independent of earlier published results and incomplete, with little comparison made between ordinary and anomalous diffusion. Such comparison is provided here and also includes variation of the mobility ratio of the mobilities of positive and negative charges from equality to charge of only one sign mobile. New generation-recombination effects are demonstrated for a range of mobility ratios, with particular attention given to those present for the case of charge of only one sign mobile. No previous analyses of experimental data with PNP models using complex-least-squares fitting have been published. Here such a model is found to fit frequency response data well for a hydrogel and to lead to estimates of physically meaningful parameters such as the diffusion constant and ionic concentration. PNP analysis of a synthetic data set derived from experimental results for liquid electrolytes refutes claims made in the original publication dealing with it, but verifies and extends an interesting analysis equation proposed there. PNP fitting of data for solids, including ones showing colossal low-frequency-limiting dielectric constants, suggests that they may often be well described as arising from simple diffuse-charge double-layer effects, and that continuum microscopic models such as the PNP, in series with a conducting Debye response model, may be sufficient for fitting well an appreciable amount of data involving ion hopping and trapping behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Several theoretical models are fitted to an exact wide-frequency-range data set representing a new random-free-energy, effective-medium expression for mobile-ion response at low temperatures. A continuous-time, random-walk K1 model, indirectly involving a stretched-exponential temporal correlation function, led to the best fit, much superior to those of two dielectric-dispersion models as well. Two types of approaches are compared for analyzing 0.4Ca(NO(3))(2).0.6KNO(3) (CKN) experimental data covering a very wide frequency range: a simplified conventional approach, usually involving only some or all of the real part of conductivity, denoted type 1, and an approach involving nonlinear least-squares fitting of full complex data over its entire range, denoted type 2. The type-2 analysis uses a composite fitting model involving the K1 and involves 10 free parameters needed to well represent electrode polarization, conductive-system dispersion, nearly constant loss, and limiting far-infrared vibrational effects. It confirmed that the latter were purely dielectric and led to sigma{''} and epsilon{''} boson peaks; included a mobile-charge explanation of the nearly constant loss region; and yielded reasonable values of the K1-model fractional exponent, beta(1), and plausible values of a completely blocking double-layer capacitance. The good type-2 fit parameter estimates were used to generate extrapolated model response over a 20-decade range at complex conductivity and complex relative permittivity levels, as well as their accurate slopes over that range. The maximum slope of the log-log sigma{'} curve failed to approximate well the value of 2 usually inferred from data of the present type but instead led to a novel double peak with peak slope values of about 1.6 and 1.7 before decreasing to zero at the limiting far-infrared plateau region of sigma{'} response. Nearly constant loss was found to be well described by the series combination of the bulk high-frequency-limiting dielectric constant of the material and a translational ionic-motion constant-phase-element expression, one whose inclusion was also needed for representing low-frequency electrode polarization effects. Further, this combination should dominate the full response at sufficiently low temperatures.},

  abstract  = {The usual expression of the finite Warburg element used for analyzing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy spectra is obtained assuming that the reaction occurs at the electrode/membrane interface and that the oxygen concentration at the gas channel/gas diffusion layer interface is constant. A simple improvement of this expression consists in the oxygen concentration depletion along the gas channel. This pseudo-two-dimensional approach should be more appropriate for the investigation of mass transfer limitations in membrane--electrode assemblies of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Starting from experimental data from the literature, numerical simulations show that conclusions about the mass transfer limiting layer and its main characteristics can be significantly modified, which can contribute to a better understanding of oxygen transport in fuel cells. The results also put forward the existence of a critical value of the air stoichiometry below, which, close to the air channel exit, no oxygen can access to the active layer. However, the diffusion impedance model does not take into account time-dependent current variation effects on the gas concentration, although experimental proofs by Schneider et al. [ J. Electrochem. Soc. , 154 , B383 (2007) ; 154 , B770 (2007)] brought that they influence significantly the shape and the size of the measured impedance spectra. },

An equivalent circuit distinguishing the kinetic parameters of lithium ion de-insertion/insertion is used to simulate the experimental impedance data. The fitting results are in good agreement with the experimental results and the parameters of the kinetic process of Li+ de-insertion and insertion in LiMn2O4 at different potentials during charge and discharge are obtained using the same circuit. The results indicate that the de-insertion/insertion behavior of lithium ions at LiMn2O4 cathode in Li2SO4 aqueous solution is similar to that reported in the organic electrolytes. The charge transfer resistance (Rct), warburg resistance, double layer capacitance and chemical diffusion coefficient (DLi+) vary with potentials during de-insertion/insertion processes. Rct is lowest at the CV peak potentials and the important kinetic parameter, DLi+ exhibits two distinct minima at potentials corresponding to CV peaks during de-insertion--insertion and it was found to be between 10$-$8 and 10$-$10cm2s$-$1during lithium de-insertion/insertion processes.},

  abstract  = {Models have previously been developed and published to predict the steady-state performance of solid polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). In general, such models have been formulated for particular fuel cells and have not been easily applicable to cells with different characteristics, dimensions, etc. The development of a generic model is described here that will accept as input not only values of the operating variables such as anode and cathode feed gas, pressure and compositions, cell temperature and current density, but also cell parameters including active area and membrane thickness. A further feature of the model is the addition of a term to account for membrane ageing. This term is based on the idea that the water-carrying capacity of the membrane deteriorates with time in service. The resulting model is largely mechanistic, with most terms being derived from theory or including coefficients that have a theoretical basis. The major nonmechanistic term is the ohmic overvoltage that is primarily empirically based. The model is applied to several sets of published data for various cells which used platinum as the anode catalyst. Data for various PEM cell designs were well correlated by the model. The lack of agreement of the model predictions with some experimental results may be due to differences in the characteristics of the electrocatalyst. The value of such a generic model to predict or correlate PEM fuel cell voltages is discussed.},

These operational conditions included a system with and without the bacterial catalyst and EIS measurements at the open-circuit potential of the anode and the cathode or at an applied cell voltage. In all cases the impedance spectra followed a simple one-time-constant model (OTCM) in which the solution resistance is in series with a parallel combination of the polarization resistance and the electrode capacitance. Analysis of the impedance spectra showed that addition of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to a solution of buffer and lactate greatly increased the rate of the lactate oxidation at the anode under open-circuit conditions. The large decrease of open-circuit potential of the anode increased the cell voltage of the MFC and its power output. Measurements of impedance spectra for the MFC at different cell voltages resulted in determining the internal resistance (Rint) of the MFC and it was found that Rint is a function of cell voltage. Additionally, Rint was equal to Rext at the cell voltage corresponding to maximum power, where Rext is the external resistance that must be applied across the circuit to obtain the maximum power output. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract ={Iron-based alkaline rechargeable batteries such as nickel-iron and iron-air batteries are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage applications because of their relatively low cost, inherent robustness to cycling, and eco-friendliness. In the present study, we demonstrate iron electrodes containing iron (II) sulfide and bismuth oxide additives that do not exhibit any noticeable capacity loss even after 1200 cycles at 100% depth of discharge in each cycle. In iron electrodes prepared with bismuth sulfide additive, capacity loss occurred during cycling, accompanied by a decrease in discharge rate capability and rapid passivation. The recovery of capacity by adding sulfide ions to the electrolyte confirmed that the electrode that suffered capacity fade did not have an adequate supply of sulfide ions. We also found that the loss of cycleability was accompanied by the steady accumulation of magnetite and loss of iron sulfides at the iron electrode. The use of sparingly soluble iron (II) sulfide as an electrode additive ensured a sustained and steady supply of sulfide preventing the accumulation of magnetite during cycling. Thus, we have gained understanding of the critical role of sulfide additives in achieving long cycle life in rechargeable alkaline iron electrodes.},

Pure metal single crystals and well-characterized bulk alloys have been used quite successfully as models for real (commercial) electrocatalysts. Given the sheer volume of all work in electrocatalysis that is on fuel cell reactions, we will focus on electrocatalysts for fuel cells. Since Pt is the model fuel cell electrocatalyst, we will focus entirely on studies of pure Pt and Pt bimetallic alloys. The electrode reactions discussed include hydrogen oxidation/evolution, oxygen reduction, and the electrooxidation of carbon monoxide, formic acid, and methanol. Surface spectroscopies emphasized are FTIR, STM/AFM and surface X-ray scattering (SXS). The discussion focuses on the relation between the energetics of adsorption of intermediates and the reaction pathway and kinetics, and how the energetics and kinetics relate to the extrinsic properties of the model system, e.g. surface structure and/or composition. Finally, we conclude by discussing the limitations that are reached by using pure metal single crystals and well-characterized bulk alloys as models for real catalysts, and suggest some directions for developing more realistic systems.

It is found that electrochemical reactions occur in a thin layer within a few micrometers thick, indicating ineffective catalyst utilization for the present catalyst layer design. The effective use of platinum catalyst decreases with increasing current density, hence lower loadings of platinum are feasible for higher current densities of practical interest without adverse effect on cell performance. The optimal void fraction for the catalyst layer is about 60\% and fairly independent of current density, and a 40\% supported platinum catalyst yields the best performance amongst various supported catalysts investigated. An optimal amount of membrane content in the void region of the catalyst layer exists for minimum cathode voltage losses due to competition between proton migration through the membrane and oxygen transfer in the void region. The present results will be useful for practical fuel cell designs.},

The use of an 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI+) salt permitted the retention of 70\% of the discharge capacity at a 4 C current rate. In contrast, similar performance of cells containing N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium (Py13 +) and N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium (PP13 +) salts of [FSI]- was limited to operation at 2 and 1 C current rates, respectively. However, the charge/discharge cycling stability of the cell with Py13[FSI] was much better than that of the cell using EMI[FSI]. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this study, we show that past reports of traditional cathode electrocatalysis in nonaqueous Li-O(2) batteries were indeed true, but that gas evolution related to electrolyte solvent decomposition was the dominant process being catalyzed. In dimethoxyethane, where Li(2)O(2) formation is the dominant product of the electrochemistry, no catalytic activity (compared to pure carbon) is observed using the same (Au, Pt, MnO(2)) nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the onset potential of oxygen evolution is only slightly higher than the open circuit potential of the cell, indicating conventional oxygen evolution electrocatalysis may be unnecessary.},

  Abstract                 = {Li-air batteries are attracting much attention because of their relatively high theoretical energy densities compared to other types of batteries and storage devices. This interest in this area is driven not only by industries requiring high electric power such as the electric car industry who requires fundamental improvements in the current Li-ion technology in order to extend the driving range of current electric vehicles, but also by many low-power and portable electronics industries which require light, high-capacity energy storage devices. In this article we first make a comparative analysis between modeling and simulation (M\&S) of semiconductor devices and the M\&S of electrochemical systems, then discuss about the potential and limitations of Li-air batteries and show how computer simulations can help increasing even more the energy density and overcome some of the limitations of these batteries.},

  Abstract                 = {The instability of currently used electrolyte solutions and of the carbon support during charge-discharge in non-aqueous lithium-oxygen cells can lead to discharge products other than the desired Li2O2, such as Li2CO3, which is believed to reduce cycle-life. Similarly, discharge in an O2 atmosphere which contains H2O and CO2 impurities would lead to LiOH and Li2CO3 discharge products. In this work we therefore investigate the rechargeability of model cathodes pre-filled with four possible Li-air cell discharge products, namely Li2O2, Li2CO3, LiOH, and Li2O. Using Online Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (OEMS), we determined the charge voltages and the gases evolved upon charge of pre-filled electrodes, thus determining the reversibility of the formation/electrooxidation reactions. We show that Li2O2 is the only reversible discharge product in ether-based electrolyte solutions, and that the formation of Li2CO3, LiOH, or Li2O is either irreversible and/or reacts with the electrolyte solution or the carbon during its oxidation.},

  abstract = {We measured the time dependence of the impedance of the electro-oxidation of methanol on polished polycrystalline platinum immersed in a solution of sulfuric acid. The impedance data were fit to a model for a reaction containing one adsorbed intermediate to obtain four physical parameters. The time dependence of these parameters illuminates how a change in the coverage of an adsorbed intermediate and the buildup of other poisons affects the kinetics and mechanism of the electro-oxidation of methanol. These results further support our conclusions based on the potential dependence of the impedance, that is, four potential regions exist between 200 and 800 mV vs RHE where a change in the mechanism for the electro-oxidation of methanol occurs (Melnick, R. E.; Palmore, G. T. R. J. Phys. Chem. B 2001, 105, 1012.). We hypothesize that changes in the mechanism are caused by the presence of four different species that contain oxygen, each belonging to a specific potential region with the more reactive species at higher potentials. We have combined impedance data from potential-dependent studies with impedance data that are time dependent to construct a qualitative model of this reaction. This model describes the rate of charge transfer for the electro-oxidation of methanol as a function of potential and coverage of adsorbed intermediate. The result is a model that predicts the behavior of this reaction at a platinum electrode, which is in agreement with that observed experimentally by impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry, and cyclic voltammetry.},

The dependencies of the Li-ion conduction (Rsl1), Li-ion solvation/desolvation (Rsl2) and charge transfer (Rct) reactions on the SOC and anode potential were evaluated. The results were compared with a dQ/dE vs. E curve of graphite to analyze how the structural changes of graphite affect the Li-ion insertion process. The charge transfer process was found to be dependent on the SOC and anode potential.

  Abstract                 = {A mathematical model is developed to describe the impedance response of a porous electrode composed of spherical intercalation particles. The model considers a porous electrode without solution-phase diffusion limitations. The model is developed by first deriving the impedance response of a single intercalation particle, obtained by solving a set of governing equations which describe charge-transfer and double-layer charging at the surface, solid-phase diffusion inside the particle, and an open-circuit potential which varies as a function of intercalant concentration. The model also considers the effect of an insulating film surrounding the particle. The governing equations are linearized to take advantage of the small amplitude of the perturbing current in impedance analysis. Once the impedance of a single particle is determined, this result is incorporated into a model which describes a porous electrode limited by ohmic drop in the solution and solid phases, and by the impedance of the particles of which the porous electrode is composed. The model can be used to examine the effect of physical properties and particle-size distributions in the porous electrode, and the usefulness of impedance analysis to measure solid-phase diffusion coefficients is scrutinized. {\copyright} 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

  abstract  = {The Faradaic impedance of a microdisk electrode inlaid in an insulating surface is revisited by numerical computation using a finite element method (FEM) with anisotropic mesh adaptation. New features of the numerical results, as compared to previous works, are analyzed. A first attractive feature is that the diffusion impedance relative to a microdisk electrode, evaluated at the equilibrium potential of the electrode, depends both on electron-transfer and mass-transport kinetics, in contrast with the usual behaviour of uniformly accessible electrodes. Next, the domain of validity of the Fleishmann and Pons semi-analytical formulation of diffusion impedance is determined. Finally, the characteristic of impedance graphs, which are the diffusion resistance, the characteristic frequency at the apex of the Nyquist diagram and the imaginary part of the diffusion impedance at this apex, are studied as functions of a dimensionless parameter that compares the standard rate constant of electron transfer to the microelectrode diffusion constant. Closed form approximations are proposed for all quantities in order to help the analysis of experimental data. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A sealed commercial cell (Sony Co.) with a nominal capacity of 840 mAh was used for the experiment. An equivalent circuit used to model the impedance spectra show that, with continuous cycling there is a relatively large increase in the interfacial impedance and charge transfer resistances after a few hundred charge-discharge cycles. It was observed that the cell capacity decrease with increase cell impedance. SEM analysis on the electrodes shows that during continuous charge-discharge cycling, the deposition of sub-micro-size particles and dissolution of surface films on the graphite surface. This observation is consistent with increase in cell impedance as a function of charge/discharge cycling. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Advances in density functional theory mean it is now possible to describe catalytic reactions at surfaces with the detail and accuracy required for computational results to compare favourably with experiments. Theoretical methods can be used to describe surface chemical reactions in detail and to understand variations in catalytic activity from one catalyst to another. Here, we review the first steps towards using computational methods to design new catalysts. Examples include screening for catalysts with increased activity and catalysts with improved selectivity. We discuss how, in the future, such methods may be used to engineer the electronic structure of the active surface by changing its composition and structure.},

The discharge voltage definitely decreased with the graphitization of as-prepared carbon in spite of almost the same chemical information of carbon surface. Graphitization of carbon led to the dramatic morphological change from granular-type to angulated-type, and as a consequence, the number of defect part toward basal part was decreased. The defect parts of the carbon surface were suggested to promote the Li+ containing oxygen reduction reaction (Li+-ORR) related with the discharge voltage. Cyclic voltammetry indicated that the ORR potential in the Li+ containing media was positively shifted on the edge oriented carbon model plane, compared with those of the graphitized ones. It was, thus, concluded that the carbon surface including defects activated the Li+-ORR process on a cathode, resulting in the increase of discharge voltage.},

The validity of the galvanostatic FTEIS technique is demonstrated by measuring impedances of a semiconductive silicon wafer using the conventional frequency response analysis (FRA), the potentiostatic FTEIS, and the galvanostatic FTEIS methods, and the results are in excellent agreement with each other. This work is significant in that the galvanostatic FTEIS would allow one to record impedance changes during charge/discharge cycles of secondary batteries and fuel cells as well as electrochemically irreversible systems which may produce noise level chronoamperometric currents by potentiostatic techniques.},

The effects of changes in electrolyte concentration, temperature and partial pressure of oxygen were investigated. The ratio of the solubility of oxygen in the electrolyte solutions to that in pure water decreases as the concentration of the electrolyte increases but is essentially independent of both temperature (over the range 298-348 K) and the oxygen partial pressure (over the range 0.1 - 1.0 atm). Empirical relationships for this solubility ratio as a function of the electrolyte concentration and temperature were developed. The predictions made using these relationships are found to be superior to the alternative methods suggested in the literature, particularly for those conditions frequently found in hydrometallurgical systems, namely at high electrolyte concentrations. The significance of changes in the solubility of oxygen in aqueous electrolyte solutions is briefly discussed with particular reference to the hydrometallurgical implications.},

The performance of Li-O<inf>2</inf> batteries was strongly affected by the salt used in the electrolyte. Lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF<inf>4</inf>) and lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) decomposed and formed LiF and lithium oxalate, respectively, as well as lithium borates during discharge of Li-O<inf>2</inf> batteries. In the case of other salts, including lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf), lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF <inf>6</inf>), lithium perchlorate (LiClO<inf>4</inf>), and lithium bromide (LiBr), the discharge products mainly consisted of Li<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and carbonates with minor signs of decomposition of LiTFSI, LiTf, and LiPF <inf>6</inf>. LiBr and LiClO<inf>4</inf> showed the best stability during the discharge process. For the cycling performance, LiTf and LiTFSI were the best among the studied salts. In addition to the instability of lithium salts, decomposition of tetraglyme solvent was a more significant factor contributing to the limited cycling stability. Thus, a more stable nonaqueous electrolyte including organic solvent and lithium salt still needs to be further developed to reach a fully reversible Li-O<inf>2</inf> battery. \&copy; 2013 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract  = {A two-dimensional model available in the literature for conventional gas distributors was expanded to account for the dimension along the length of the channel. The channel was discretized into control volumes in series that were treated as well mixed. An iterative solution procedure was incorporated in each control volume to determine the average current density and the corresponding oxygen consumption and water generation rates. Downstream channel concentrations were calculated based on stoichiometric flow rates and the solution obtained from the preceding control volumes. Comparison of the model results with experimental data and the existing two-dimensional model showed that accounting for the oxygen concentration variations along the channel and its effect on the current density is critical for accurately predicting the cathode performance. Variations in the current density along the channel were strongly influenced by the changes in oxygen concentration caused by consumption due to reaction and dilution caused by water evaporation. Operating parameters that facilitated better water removal by evaporation like higher temperature and stoichiometric flow rates and lower inlet stream humidity resulted in higher net current. Operating conditions that resulted in minimal loss in oxygen concentrations resulted in a more uniform current density distribution along the channel.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a study on the effect of inhomogeneous compression of gas diffusion layer (GDL) caused by the channel/rib structure of flow-field plate. The experimentally evaluated properties are GDL intrusion into the channel, gas permeability, in-plane and through-plane bulk electric conductivities, and contact resistances at interfaces as a function of compressed thickness of GDL. It was found that the GDL is compressed very little under the channel whereas GDL under the rib is compressed to gasket thickness. The compression of GDL reduces gas permeability and contact resistance, and improves bulk conductivity. Hence, the inhomogeneous compression of GDL may lead into significant local variation of mass and charge transport properties in the GDL. These effects have been ignored in most of the published modeling studies. This contribution, part I, covers the experimental setup and measurement results, and a model which takes the inhomogeneous compression of GDL into account is presented in part II.},

The thermal property, density, self-diffusion coefficient of the anions and cations, viscosity, and ionic conductivity were measured for these ionic liquids in wide temperature ranges. A pulsed-gradient spinecho NMR method was used to independently measure self-diffusion coefficients of the anions (19F NMR) and the cations (1H NMR). The results indicate that the cations diffuse almost equally to the anion in EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas they diffuse faster than the anion in EMITFSI and BPTFSI. The summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coefficients for each ionic liquid follows the order EMITFSI > EMIBF4 > BPTFSI > BPBF4, under an isothermal condition. The order of the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient well contrasts with that of the viscosity for each ionic liquid. The temperature dependencies of the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and ionic conductivity obey the VogelTammanFulcher (VTF) equation, and the VTF parameters were presented. Relationships among the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and molar conductivity were analyzed in terms of the StokesEinstein equation and the NernstEinstein equation. The most interesting feature of the relationships is that the ratios of the molar conductivity, determined by complex impedance measurements, to that calculated from the NMR diffusion coefficients, range from 0.6 to 0.8 for EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas the ratios range from 0.3 to 0.5 for EMITFSI and BPTFSI. This difference could be understood by taking the ionic association into consideration for EMITFSI and BPTFSI.},

  abstract  = {Rechargeable lithium batteries represent one of the most important developments in energy storage for 100 years, with the potential to address the key problem of global warming. However, their ability to store energy is limited by the quantity of lithium that may be removed from and reinserted into the positive intercalation electrode, Li(x)CoO(2), 0.5 < x < 1 (corresponding to 140 mA.h g(-1) of charge storage). Abandoning the intercalation electrode and allowing Li to react directly with O(2) from the air at a porous electrode increases the theoretical charge storage by a remarkable 5-10 times! Here we demonstrate two essential prerequisites for the successful operation of a rechargeable Li/O(2) battery; that the Li(2)O(2) formed on discharging such an O(2) electrode is decomposed to Li and O(2) on charging (shown here by in situ mass spectrometry), with or without a catalyst, and that charge/discharge cycling is sustainable for many cycles.},

  Abstract                 = {Lithium-oxygen batteries have a great potential to enhance the gravimetric energy density of fully packaged batteries by two to three times that of lithium ion cells. Recent studies have focused on finding stable electrolytes to address poor cycling capability and improve practical limitations of current lithium-oxygen batteries. In this study, the catalyst electrode, where discharge products are deposited and decomposed, was investigated as it has a critical role in the operation of rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries. Here we report the electrode design principle to improve specific capacity and cycling performance of lithium-oxygen batteries by utilizing high-efficiency nanocatalysts assembled by M13 virus with earth-abundant elements such as manganese oxides. By incorporating only 3-5 wt\% of palladium nanoparticles in the electrode, this hybrid nanocatalyst achieves 13,350 mAh g(-1)(c) (7,340 mAh g(-1)(c+catalyst)) of specific capacity at 0.4 A g(-1)(c) and a stable cycle life up to 50 cycles (4,000 mAh g(-1)(c), 400 mAh g(-1)(c+catalyst)) at 1 A g(-1)(c).},

The best performance for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions was observed for the KB electrode, which has the highest surface area among the carbon materials examined. A steady over-potential of 0.2{~}V was obtained for the oxygen reduction reaction using the KB electrode without the catalyst, while the over-potential was 0.15{~}V for KB with the LSCF catalyst at 2.0{~}mA{~}cm$-$2. The over-potentials for the oxygen evolution reaction were slightly higher than those for the oxygen reduction reaction, and gradually increased with the polarization period. Analysis of the gas in the cell after polarization above 0.4{~}V revealed the evolution of a small amount of CO during the oxygen evolution reaction by the decomposition of carbon in the electrode. The amount of CO evolved was significantly decreased by the addition of LSCF to the carbon electrode.},

Higher power output requires faster charge transfer reactions in the charge/discharge process. Because lower activation energy directly correlates to faster Li ion diffusion, the activation energy for ionic diffusion throughout the electrode materials is of primary importance. In this study, we demonstrate a simple, versatile electrochemical method to determine the activation energy for ionic diffusion in electrode materials via temperature dependent capacitometry. A generalized form of the temperature dependence of the discharge capacity was derived from the diffusion equation. This method yielded activation energy values for Li ion diffusion in LiCoO2 comparable to those obtained from ab initio calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {Today's unresolved issues in impedance spectroscopy are driven by the observation that impedance spectroscopy provides only an indirect characterization of a given system. A consequence of the inferential character of impedance spectroscopy is that many models can provide fits that fall within the apparent confidence limits of the data. Therefore impedance spectroscopy cannot be regarded as being a {\textquotedblleft}stand-alone{\textquotedblright} technique. The non-uniqueness of impedance models is currently being addressed by incorporating independent in-situ and ex-situ analyses into impedance experiments, by varying additional parameters (or forcing functions) such as temperature, mass transfer rates, energy of incident monochromatic illumination and intensity of broad-band illumination, and by incorporating measurements of additional properties such as mass. Improvements in interpretation will also be driven by incorporation of more sophisticated statistical treatment of data and models.},

The experimental approach to these systems initially focused on the design of molecules with specific interactions that lead to discrete geometric structures, and more recently on the kinetics and mechanistic pathways of self-assembly. However, there remains a major gap in our understanding of the internal conformational dynamics of these systems and of the links between their dynamics and function. Molecular dynamics simulations have yielded information on the molecular fluctuations of supramolecular assemblies, yet experimentally it has been difficult to obtain analogous data with subnanometre spatial resolution. Using site-directed spin labelling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we measured the conformational dynamics of a self-assembled nanofibre in water through its 6.7 nm cross-section. Our measurements provide unique insight for the design of supramolecular functional materials.},

It is found that the impedance spectrum of 2-propanol is very similar to that of methanol. Semicircles that have induction loops at the low frequency ends were observed in complex plane plots at high potentials between 600 and 750 mV in both the cases of 2-propanol and methanol, which suggests that the rate-determining steps of the electro-oxidation of intermediates adsorbed on platinum should be involved in their reaction processes. Assuming appropriate models involving the adsorbed intermediates for 2-propanol and methanol, the impedance spectra were explained successfully. The impedance analysis provides the values of reaction parameters concerning a coverage relaxation time for an intermediate and a charge-transfer resistance, which make it possible to compare the reaction rates of the intermediates between 2-propanol and methanol. The reaction parameters suggest that a consecutive reaction involving the intermediate for 2-propanol proceeds more slowly than that for methanol, and also suggest that a direct reaction pathway from 2-propanol to acetone, which does not go through the intermediate, exists in parallel. Additionally, the influences of acetone concentration on the coverage relaxation time and the charge-transfer resistance for the electro-oxidation of 2-propanol were also discussed. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {Carbon has been used widely as the basis of porous cathodes for nonaqueous Li-O(2) cells. However, the stability of carbon and the effect of carbon on electrolyte decomposition in such cells are complex and depend on the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the carbon surface. Analyzing carbon cathodes, cycled in Li-O(2) cells between 2 and 4 V, using acid treatment and Fenton{'}s reagent, and combined with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and FTIR, demonstrates the following: Carbon is relatively stable below 3.5 V (vs Li/Li(+)) on discharge or charge, especially so for hydrophobic carbon, but is unstable on charging above 3.5 V (in the presence of Li(2)O(2)), oxidatively decomposing to form Li(2)CO(3). Direct chemical reaction with Li(2)O(2) accounts for only a small proportion of the total carbon decomposition on cycling. Carbon promotes electrolyte decomposition during discharge and charge in a Li-O(2) cell, giving rise to Li(2)CO(3) and Li carboxylates (DMSO and tetraglyme electrolytes). The Li(2)CO(3) and Li carboxylates present at the end of discharge and those that form on charge result in polarization on the subsequent charge. Li(2)CO(3) (derived from carbon and from the electrolyte) as well as the Li carboxylates (derived from the electrolyte) decompose and form on charging. Oxidation of Li(2)CO(3) on charging to {\^{a}}*{$\frac{1}{4}$}4 V is incomplete; Li(2)CO(3) accumulates on cycling resulting in electrode passivation and capacity fading. Hydrophilic carbon is less stable and more catalytically active toward electrolyte decomposition than carbon with a hydrophobic surface. If the Li-O(2) cell could be charged at or below 3.5 V, then carbon may be relatively stable, however, its ability to promote electrolyte decomposition, presenting problems for its use in a practical Li-O(2) battery. The results emphasize that stable cycling of Li(2)O(2) at the cathode in a Li-O(2) cell depends on the synergy between electrolyte and electrode; the stability of the electrode and the electrolyte cannot be considered in isolation.},

  abstract  = {Rechargeable lithium-air (O2) batteries are receiving intense interest because their high theoretical specific energy exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries. If the Li-O2 battery is ever to succeed, highly reversible formation/decomposition of Li2O2 must take place at the cathode on cycling. However, carbon, used ubiquitously as the basis of the cathode, decomposes during Li2O2 oxidation on charge and actively promotes electrolyte decomposition on cycling. Replacing carbon with a nanoporous gold cathode, when in contact with a dimethyl sulphoxide-based electrolyte, does seem to demonstrate better stability. However, nanoporous gold is not a suitable cathode; its high mass destroys the key advantage of Li-O2 over Li ion (specific energy), it is too expensive and too difficult to fabricate. Identifying a suitable cathode material for the Li-O2 cell is one of the greatest challenges at present. Here we show that a TiC-based cathode reduces greatly side reactions (arising from the electrolyte and electrode degradation) compared with carbon and exhibits better reversible formation/decomposition of Li2O2 even than nanoporous gold (>98% capacity retention after 100 cycles, compared with 95% for nanoporous gold); it is also four times lighter, of lower cost and easier to fabricate. The stability may originate from the presence of TiO2 (along with some TiOC) on the surface of TiC. In contrast to carbon or nanoporous gold, TiC seems to represent a more viable, stable, cathode for aprotic Li-O2 cells.},

Such diagnostic methods are desired to probe the influence of factors such as charge rate, electrode structure and solid electrolyte interphase layer transport resistance as they relate to lithium-ion battery performance and durability. In this work, we present a continuous measurement of through-plane lithium distributions in a composite graphite/lithium metal electrochemical cell. Capacity change in a thick graphite electrode was measured during several charge/discharge cycles with high resolution (14$\mu$m) neutron imaging. A custom test fixture and a method for quantifying lithium are described. The measured lithium distribution within the graphite electrode is given as a function of state of charge. Bulk transport resistance is considered by comparing intercalation rates through the thickness of the electrode near the separator and current collector. The residual lithium content associated with irreversible capacity loss that results from cycling is also measured.},

These quantities can be calculated by solving a system of time dependent nonlinear coupled partial differential equations, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. Assuming small deviations from the electroneutral equilibrium, the linearized and decoupled equations are solved for a radial symmetric geometry, which represents the interface between a cell and a sensor device. The densities and the potential are expressed by Fourier-Bessels series. The system considered has a ratio between the Debye-length and its geometric dimension on the order of 10(-4) so the Fourier-Bessel series can be approximated by elementary functions. The time development of the system is characterized by two time constants, $\tau$c and $\tau$g. The constant $\tau$c describes the approach to the stationary state of the total charge and the potential. $\tau$c is several orders of magnitude smaller than the geometry-dependent constant $\tau$g, which is on the order of 10 ms characterizing the transition to the stationary state of the single ion densities.},

The main conclusion is that the water transport in the membrane plays an important role in establishing the limiting polarization behavior of polymer electrolyte fuel cells, corresponding to the only limiting factor when pure oxygen is employed as the cathodic reagent. When the oxygen source is air, the diffusion of oxygen in the gas phase becomes a limiting factor, but for pressurized systems the diffusion of water can also be observed, especially for thick membranes.},

  abstract  = {The behavior of water in the gas diffusion layers of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was investigated analytically. To understand the water transportation phenomena systematically, the gas diffusion layers were divided into two parts. One is the gas diffusion medium (GDM) and the other is micro-layer (ML). In this work, the GDM with different PTFE contents was intensively investigated under various single cell operation conditions. I--V performance curves of single cells were compared and analyzed with respect to water transportation in the GDM. The increased PTFE contents disturb the ejection of liquid-phase water from the electrodes to the flow channels via the GDM, especially at higher relative humidity conditions. I--V performance curves in this work can also be interpreted as an evidence that capillary force in the GDM is not the main driving force for the water transportation. Other forces, for example shear force of fluid and water evaporation etc. are more dominant driving forces, at least with in the GDM itself. This is because of the relatively larger pore diameter of the GDM compared to that of electrodes and ML. When a ML was used in the GDM, the I--V performance of fuel cell became more stabilized as well as enhanced. In regard to water management, the ML might have important roles as buffer zone which prevent serious drying and flooding of the electrode. So, when the entire gas diffusion part is designed, the capillary-force-driven water movement and the shear-force- or vaporization-driven water transportation should be considered carefully for both the ML and the GDM structures.},

As a result, the development of clean energy systems is becoming an urgent focus for the research community. Metal air batteries have attracted much attention due to their extremely high energy density, and the rechargeability which is directly governed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we present a new class of hybrid bi-functional catalyst consisting of porous nanorod perovskite La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF-PR) combined with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) active towards both ORR and OER. The novel morphology of LSCF-PR is prepared by an electrospinning method, and incorporated into NRGO sheets. Electron microscopy reveals interesting composite morphology in which LSCF-PR is embedded between the sheets of NRGO, forming an efficient LSCF-PR/NRGO composite morphology for the electrochemical oxygen reactions. Electrochemical testing of the LSCF-PR/NRGO composite in alkaline medium results in excellent ORR and OER catalytic activities, verifying the effective combination for bi-functionality. LSCF-PR/NRGO presents not only a comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst for ORR or OER, respectively, but also better durability. These results highlight the applicability of LSCF-PR/NRGO composite having unique and efficient morphology as a promising bi-functional catalyst for metal air battery applications.},

Carbon paper with various PTFE contents and thicknesses is used as the anode diffusion layer. In the case of the DBFC, both hydrogen evolution and liquid fuel diffusion have to be considered while selecting an anode diffusion layer. Among the various PTFE-containing diffusion layers, the non-contained diffusion layer yields the best performance. Adding PTFE to the diffusion layer leads to improved gas transport but is unsuitable in the DBFC. In addition, the thinnest (100$\mu$m) diffusion layer gives the best performance among the diffusion layers with various thicknesses. The decrease in the length of the diffusion path is beneficial for both the release of hydrogen gas and the diffusion of liquid fuel. In addition, it is found that the hydrogen evolution rate increases with increasing cell performance. Overall, adequate diffusion of liquid fuel is more important for the performance of a DBFC than the release of hydrogen gas.},

This paper reviews recent developments of single- and dual-layer GDLs for PEM fuel cells and various materials and approaches used for development of novel GDL. A variety of carbon- and metal-based macroporous substrates are presented. Hydrophobic treatments using different fluorinated polymers are addressed. Engineering parameters which control the performance of microporous layer such as carbon treatment, wettability, thickness, and microstructure are also reviewed. In addition, future prospects for development of new GDL development are discussed.},

When air was used as an oxidant, a maximum fuel cell performance was obtained for a carbon loading of 0.5mgcm$-$2. The ac-impedance properties were analyzed based on the thin film/flooded-agglomerate dynamics in the catalyst layer and the oxygen diffusion kinetics in the gas diffusion layer. The ac-impedance study indicated that the optimized microporous layer results in an effective water management (i.e. a balancing of water saturations in the catalyst layer and the gas diffusion layer), thereby improving the oxygen diffusion kinetics.},

Low platinum loading (0.1mgcm2) electrodes with a Nafion content ranging from 14 to 66wt\% were studied. The performance of PEFC electrodes is affected by the Nafion content and an optimal content of about 33wt\% of ionomer was found. Hg intrusion porosimetry and cyclic voltammetry were carried out to evaluate the pore size distribution and the electrochemical surface area respectively. These data were correlated with single-cell performance. The electrochemical experimental data were analysed using a theoretical equation and the kinetics parameters obtained were related to the catalytic layer structure.},

This allows the determination of kinetic data, such as reaction orders or apparent activation energies, for the orr directly without mathematical modeling. Collection experiments reveal a potential and rotation rate independent collection efficiency. RRDE measurements allow, for the first time, the direct determination of the fraction of peroxide production during oxygen reduction on supported catalysts. Finally, comparison of measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M HClO4, respectively, reveals a significant effect of (bi)sulfate adsorption on the orr activity. On the basis of the present results, predictions are made on the kinetic limit of the orr in polymer electrolyte fuel cells, in the absence of ohmic and mass transport resistances at 100\% utilization.},

One aim is to yield insight into electrical double layer physics and study the applicability of continuum theory to nanoscale electrokinetic systems. A second aim is to explore a new separation modality offered by nanoscale electrophoretic separations. We perform parametric variations of applied electric field, channel depth, background buffer concentration, and species valence to impose variations on zeta potential, effective mobility, and Debye length among other parameters. These measurements were used to validate a continuum theory-based analytical model presented in the first of this two-paper series. Our results confirm the usefulness of continuum theory in predicting electrokinetic transport and electrophoretic separations in nanochannels. Our model leverages independent measurements of zeta potential performed in a microchannel system at electrolyte concentrations of interest. These data yield a zeta potential versus concentration relation that is used as a boundary condition for the nanochannel electrokinetic transport model. The data and model comparisons together show that the effective mobility governing electrophoretic transport of charged species in nanochannels depends not only on ion mobility values but also on the shape of the electric double layer and analyte ion valence. We demonstrate a method we term electrokinetic separation by ion valence, whereby both ion valence and mobility may be determined independently from a comparison of micro- and nanoscale transport measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated by development of lithium-ion batteries, we study the structure and dynamics of LiBF(4) in pure and mixed solvents with various salt concentrations. For this purpose, we have developed force field models for ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and dimethoxyethane. We find that Li(+) is preferentially solvated by the cyclic and more polar component of the mixtures, as the electrostatic interaction overcomes possible steric hindrances. The cation coordination number decreases from 6 to 5 with increasing salt concentration due to formation of ion-pairs. The uniform decline of the diffusion coefficients of the two ions is disrupted at mixture compositions that perturb the ion-pair interaction. We show that the Stokes' model of diffusion can be applied to the very small Li(+) ion, provided that the size of the first solvation shell is properly taken into consideration. The strong coordination of the ions by the polar, cyclic components of the solvent mixtures established in our simulations suggests that the less polar linear component can be optimized in order to reduce electrolyte viscosity and to achieve high electrical conductivity.},

  abstract = {Mixed-valence manganites with the ABO3 perovskite structure display a variety of magnetic and structural transitions, dramatic changes of electrical conductivity and magnetoresistance effects. The physical properties vary with the relative concentration of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the octahedral corner-sharing network, and the proportion of these two cations is usually changed by doping the trivalent large A cation (for example, La3+) with divalent cations. As the dopant and the original cation have, in general, different sizes, and as they are distributed randomly in the structure, such systems are characterized by local distortions that make it difficult to obtain direct information about their crystallographic and physical properties. On the other hand, the double oxides of formula AA'3Mn4O12 contain a perovskite-like network of oxygen octahedra centred on the Mn cations, coupled with an ordered arrangement of the A and A' cations, whose valences control the proportion of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the structure. The compound investigated in this work, (NaMn3+(3))(Mn3+(2)Mn4+(2))O12, contains an equal number of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the octahedral sites. We show that the absence of disorder enables the unambiguous determination of symmetry, the direct observation of full, or nearly full, charge ordering of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in distinct crystallographic sites, and a nearly perfect orbital ordering of the Mn3+ octahedra.},

The electrochemical activity of such a catalyst is also tested using surface electrochemical methods. Three one-electron transfer redox processes in the studied potential range are identified, where only one such a process is associated with the catalyst's ORR activity. The effect of KOH on the Co-N-S/C catalyzed ORR kinetics is investigated using the rotating disk electrode technique in a concentration range of 0.05 to 6.0M. Several ORR kinetic parameters such as overall electron transfer number (n), the product of electron transfer number and coefficient in ORR rate determining step ( ? n ), and the exchange current density ? ( o i O H O ) are estimated. The results show that values of n at different KOH concentrations are close to 2 / 2 4.0, suggesting that Co-N-S/C catalyzed ORR is a 4-electron transfer process from O2 to H2O. KOH concentration has an insignificant effect on the value of n, however, a significant effect is observed on both values of ? n ? ? ? and o i O H O . ( n 2 / ? ? decreases while that of o i O H O increases with increasing KOH 2 / 2 2 concentration).},

  abstract  = {An in-depth insight in the role of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and its impact on the water management is a key issue for the optimization of fuel cells. A new ex situ test method is developed to investigate the water transport in gas diffusion media for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This research is focused on properties of GDLs, which influence the water removal and water retention in the cell. Gas diffusion media are evaluated ex situ in terms of liquid water and water vapor transport employing a conventional PEMFC setup. The amount of water transported through a GDL and out of the cell is determined by the properties of the gas diffusion medium. GDL properties such as the GDL thickness have a significant impact on water transport behavior. Furthermore, high impregnation weight or an additional micro-porous layer (MPL) reduces water removal due to enhanced mass transport resistances. The composition and distribution of the impregnation material in the GDL substrate also play a crucial role. Water transport rates depend not only on the GDL properties but increase exponentially with cell temperature. Finally, a two-phase water transport model is proposed taking into account both diffusive gas phase and liquid water transport in diffusion media. Based on this model, ex situ data set in correlation with in situ performance in PEMFCs on dry operating conditions and guidelines towards new design concepts for gas diffusion media are deduced.},

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is used to study the electrical properties of these prepared glasses. Modulus formalism is introduced to study relaxation behaviour of these glasses. Scaling model shows the good overlap of data on single master curve which suggests that conduction mechanism in these glasses is compositional dependent. Variation of dielectric constant and dielectric loss with the addition of Sm2O3 and frequency are discussed here.},

Application of carbon nanotubes (CNT) as an additive to the cathode catalyst layer resulted in the increase of BET surface area and porosity of the catalyst layer due to filamentous morphology of CNT. Best performance was observed at the intermediate CNT/catalyst ratio of 0.05. I--U polarization and impedance analysis indicated that the faster oxygen reduction reaction at the open cathode is responsible for the power density improvement. Excessive cathode porosity was not favorable due to the decrease of the effective ionic conductivity of the catalyst layer.},

On the basis of a simple model we identify the critical nucleus involved in the transition mechanism and calculate the nucleation barrier from which we obtain information on the nucleation time. Close to the condensation point, the theory predicts extremely large energy barriers leading to strong metastabilities, long time dependencies, and large hysteresis in agreement with experimental observations in mesoporous media. The validity of the model is assessed using a numerical simulation of a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model for the confined system.},

  abstract  = {A non-destructive estimation of the state-of-charge (SoC) of batteries facilitates optimum utilization of the battery for a given application, as well as evaluation of its state-of-health. Among various methods, a.c. impedance spectroscopy over a wide range of frequencies provides a variety of parameters which are functions of the SoC of a given battery. These parameters and their variation with SoC depend on the type of battery and on the experimental conditions. The impedance data of sealed commercial cells are rather tedious to analyze since the results are generally the combined parameters of both the positive and the negative electrodes. Separation of the parameters which correspond to the individual electrodes involves assumptions, the validity of which is open to question. Nevertheless, systematic linear and reproducible variations of measurable or computable impedance parameters with battery condition are useful indicators of the SoC in a non-destructive way. The present review consolidates the literature on the prediction of the SoC of batteries by means of a.c. impedance measurements.},

Derivation of nonequilibrium electro-osmotic slip condition is recapitulated along with the linear stability analysis of quiescent electrodiffusion through a flat ion exchange membrane. Results of numerical calculation for nonlinear steady state convection, developing from the respective instability, are reported along with those for a slightly wavy membrane. Besides these results, we report those of time dependent calculations for periodic and chaotic oscillations, resulting from instability of the respective steady state flows, and also the results of recent experiments with modified membranes. These latter rule in favor of electro-osmotic versus bulk electroconvective origin of overlimiting conductance through ion exchange membranes.},

  Abstract                 = {Controlling the mesoscale geometric configuration of catalysts on the oxygen electrode is an effective strategy to achieve high reversibility and efficiency in Li-O2 batteries. Here we introduce a new Li-O2 cell architecture that employs a catalytic polymer-based membrane between the oxygen electrode and the separator. The catalytic membrane was prepared by immobilization of Pd nanoparticles on a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber membrane and is adjacent to a carbon nanotube electrode loaded with Ru nanoparticles. During oxide product formation, the insulating PAN polymer scaffold restricts direct electron transfer to the Pd catalyst particles and prevents the direct blockage of Pd catalytic sites. The modified Li-O2 battery with a catalytic membrane showed a stable cyclability for 60 cycles with a capacity of 1000 mAh/g and a reduced degree of polarization (\~{} 0.3 V) compared to cells without a catalytic membrane. We demonstrate the effects of a catalytic membrane on the reaction characteristics associated with morphological and structural features of the discharge products via detailed ex situ characterization.},

  abstract  = {To understand the deterioration of cycle performance and energy efficiency related with non-aqueous rechargeable Li--air batteries, a micro--macro homogeneous model has been developed to include the practical feature of Li2CO3 formation which occurs by electrolyte degradation during battery cycling. The discharge products can limit the cyclability and passivate the porous-cathode surface. A modelling study of cycling behaviour and cell performance for Li--air batteries in a non-aqueous electrolyte is presented which includes the influence of electrolyte solution degradation. The cycle performance deterioration measured in term of retention of discharge capacity on cycling was predicted from the developed model which includes the effect of irreversible Li2CO3 discharge product. A good agreement between this cell cycling simulation and porous-electrode experiment data is obtained, thus creating a more reliable model for a rechargeable Li--air battery in non-aqueous electrolyte. The cell cycling simulation and porous-electrode experiment indicate that there has been gradual decrease for retention of discharge capacity in a number of battery cycles due to the effect of irreversible formation of the Li2CO3 discharge product. The termination of the cell discharge is not from the pore blockage by the repeated depositing of discharge products as there are some available pores at the end of each discharge cycle.},

The fuel cell employed for the experiments is a single PEMFC with a 25cm2 Nafion{\textregistered} 115 membrane. As expected, a higher cell temperature increases the membrane conductivity and the exchange current density with an improvement of the cell behaviour. An increase in the reactant saturation temperature also leads to a better performance, especially in the case of low and medium loads. Conversely, in the case of a low cell temperature, it is better to reduce the water inlet mass flow at high loads to avoid electrode flooding. With an increase of the reactant operating pressure, the maximum of the power curve shifts to higher current densities, and this could be linked to the corresponding shift of the limiting current density. A combined effect of humidification and operating pressure was observed: the increase of operating pressure did not offer a significant improvement when the reactants were dry, while leading to improvements when a partial humidification (only at the anode) was adopted. The best improvements due to a pressure increase were observed when both anode and cathode are humidified. Finally, some tests of other authors at the same operation conditions have been considered, and a comparison has been done.},

Three types of cathode structures, including two-layer (gas diffusion layer (GDL) and catalyst layer (CL)), three-layer (GDL, micro porous layer (MPL) and CL), and multi-layer (GDL, CL, carbon based layer (CBL) and hydrophobic layers) structures were examined and compared in single-chamber MFCs (SCMFCs). The results showed that the three-layer (3L) cathode structures had lower water loss than other cathodes and had a high power density (501{~}mW/m2). The MPL in the 3L cathode structure prevented biofilm penetration into the cathode structure, which facilitated the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. The SCMFCs with the 3L cathodes had a low ohmic resistance (Rohmic: 26--34{~}$\Omega$) and a high cathode open circuit potential (OCP: 191{~}mV). The organic substrate removal efficiency (71--78\%) in the SCMFCs with 3L cathodes was higher than the SCMFCs with two-layer and multi-layer cathodes (49--68\%). This study demonstrated that inserting the MPL between CL and GDL substantially enhanced the overall electrical conduction, power generation and organic substrate removal in MFCs by reducing water loss and preventing biofilm infiltration into the cathode structure.},

  abstract  = {Our experimental results shown here disprove that finite diffusion can generally be assumed in ac impedance models for H-2/air-polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) to account for the diffusive transport of oxygen through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) toward the air electrode. It is shown that the amplitude of the oxygen concentration oscillation created as a consequence of superimposed ac current at the air electrode is not zero at the channel/GDL interface but extends into the gas channels, at least below modulation frequencies of f(mod)=10 Hz. By this, sinusoidal oxygen-concentration oscillations within the cathode gas channels are excited locally along the flow field. Due to the forced air convection in the cathode flow-field channels, a coupling via the gas phase occurs downstream of the flow field. The coupling strongly affects the local and by this the overall impedance response of the cell and evokes the formation of a low-frequency arc in H-2/air-PEFC impedance spectra. Based on the experimental results, a qualitative model is presented explaining the local impedance response of a segmented 200 cm(2) H-2/air PEFC},

The method combines the use of sectioned electrodes and local ac measurements in PEFCs. The results shown here give experimental proof that oxygen concentration oscillations in the cathode gas channels generated as a consequence of ac current flow evoke the formation of a low frequency capacitive loop in local H-2/air-PEFC impedance spectra in downstream parts of the flow field. The loop shows positive or negative real parts at low frequencies depending on the air stoichiometry. The loop is not observed in the local spectrum when the ac current is applied locally and, consequently, the impact of upstream processes on the local impedance response is excluded. A mechanistic description of the processes occurring during ac measurements in H-2/air-PEFCs was developed and validated by experiments. The results show that processes occurring along the flow channels of a PEFC cannot be excluded from the interpretation of PEFC impedance spectra even at rather high air stoichiometries and are in fact the most important phenomena at low modulation frequencies (f(mod)< 10 Hz).},

  abstract  = {The influence of the anode and cathode GDL wettability on the current and media distribution was studied using combined in situ high resolution neutron radiography and locally resolved current distribution measurements. MEAs were prepared by vertically splitting either the anode or cathode carbon cloth into a less hydrophobic part (untreated carbon cloth {\textquoteleft}as received{\textquoteright}) and a more hydrophobic part (carbon cloth impregnated by PTFE dispersion). Both parts were placed side by side to obtain a complete electrode and hot-pressed with a Nafion membrane. MEAs with partitioned anode carbon cloth revealed no difference between the untreated and the hydrophobised part of the cell concerning the fluid and current distribution. The power generation of both parts was almost equal and the cell performance was similar to that of an undivided MEA (110mWcm$-$2, 300mAcm$-$2, 70$\deg$C). In contrast, MEAs with partitioned cathode carbon cloth showed a better performance for the hydrophobised part, which contributed to about 60\% of the overall power generation. This is explained by facilitated oxygen transport especially in the hydrophobised part of the cathode gas diffusion layer. At an average current density of 300mAcm$-$2, a pronounced flooding of the cathode flow field channels adjacent to the untreated part of GDL led to a further loss of performance in this part of the cell. The low power density of the untreated part caused a significant loss of cell performance, which amounted to less than 40mWcm$-$2 (at 300mAcm$-$2).},

  abstract  = {Non-aqueous Li-air-batteries can provide potentially a very high energy density. The reaction at the positive electrode is the oxygen reduction reaction. Its products are lithium oxides (mainly Li2O2) that deposit as solid compound in the porous gas diffusion electrode (GDE). This can cause passivation of the electrode surface or clogging of gas diffusion pathway though the porous material. Here a new method is reported to measure in-situ the oxygen permeation though a GDE during the discharge process. It is based on the concepts of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in which a positionable microelectrode (ME) is used to detect the influx of oxygen in an deaerated electrolyte close to the outer surface of the GDE. However, no steady-state current for oxygen reduction at the ME can be obtained in Li-containing electrolytes because solid lithium oxides also deposit on the ME. Therefore, a pulsed potential program was developed that periodically removes deposits from the surface of the ME and eliminates the effect of surface passivation of the probe electrode. We validated this method by monitoring the oxygen reduction current at the ME as a result of oxygen permeating GDEs of different thickness.},

In addition, Rint took a value close to the capacity ratio between small- (280 mAh) and large-capacity (7 Ah) cells when the internal resistances of the two cells calculated from the ac impedance spectrum were compared. These results indicate that interfacial degradation, which is one of the main factors causing battery degradation, can be estimated by analyzing Rint using a smaller cell.},

According to this model, maximum concentrations of available Li sites in the polymer lattice are calculated and are in good agreement with conductivity measurements reported elsewhere. $$nValues of the exchange current density, io, are calculated for a range of experimental conditions and are particularly high at higher temperatures, (e.g., at 140{\^{A}}{$^\circ$}C and x=9, io=11.2 mA/cm2).

  Abstract                 = {NiF2/C composites were prepared through high energy mechanical milling, and the cyclic performance was characterized by discharge-charge measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) for NiF2/C electrode were obtained at different potentials during initial discharge-charge cycle. The results revealed the typical EIS characteristics appeared with three semicircles in the Nyquist diagram at 1.6 V. An equivalent circuit was proposed to simulate the experimental EIS data, and it was found that the high frequency semicircle (HFS) is mainly caused by lithium-ion through the SEI film on the electrode surface, the middle frequency semicircle (MFS) should be related to the Schottky contact between NiF2 and conductive agents, which may be the important feature of such composites materials with big band gap, Besides the low frequency arc (LFA) was observed as the charge transfer step. Consequently a modified model was proposed to explain the impedance response of NiF2/C electrode for lithium ion batteries.},

The molarity of LiOH and LiCl in the LiOH and LiCl saturated aqueous solution were estimated to be 5.12 and 11.57M, respectively, by analysis of Li+ and OH$-$. The high concentration of LiOH and the low pH value of 8.14 in this solution suggested that the dissociation of LiOH into Li+ and OH$-$ is too low in the solution with a high concentration of Li+. These results suggest that the water stable LTAP could be used as a protect layer of the lithium metal anode in the lithium/air cell with LiCl saturated aqueous solution as the electrolyte, because the content of OH$-$ ions in the LiCl saturated aqueous solution does not increase via the cell reaction of Li+1/2O2+H2O$\rightarrow$2LiOH, and LTAP is stable under a deep discharge state.},

Excellent reversibility and cycleability were also demonstrated for the newly developed oxygen electrode. The observed outstanding performance can be attributed to its unique vertically aligned, coral-like N-doped carbon microstructure with a high catalytic activity and an optimized oxygen/electron transportation capability, coupled with the microporous stainless steel substrate. These results demonstrate that highly efficient and reversible Li-O2 batteries are feasible by using a rationally designed carbon-based oxygen electrode.},

The evaluation of Li2 O2 grain size, concentration, and spatial distribution inside the cathode is demonstrated under the actual cycling conditions. The study not only unambiguously proved the reversibility of the Li2 O2 redox reaction during reduction and evolution of O2 , but also allowed for the concentration and dimension growths of the peroxide nanocrystallites to be accurately measured at different regions within the cathode. The results provide important insights for future investigation on mass and charge transport properties in Li2 O2 and improvement in cathode structure and material design.},

Examination of the asymptotic behaviour as the contact line is approached shows that the relaxation of the classical model of a sharp liquid-gas interface, whilst retaining the no-slip condition, resolves the stress and pressure singularities associated with the moving contact line problem while the fluid velocity is well defined (not multi-valued). The moving contact line behaviour is analysed for a general problem relevant for any density dependent dynamic viscosity and volume viscosity, and for general microscopic contact angle and double well free-energy forms. Away from the contact line, analysis of the diffuse-interface model shows that the Navier--Stokes equations and classical interfacial boundary conditions are obtained at leading order in the sharp-interface limit, justifying the creeping flow problem imposed in an intermediate region in the seminal work of Seppecher [Int. J. Eng. Sci. 34, 977--992 (1996)]. Corrections to Seppecher's work are given, as an incorrect solution form was originally used.},

Better membrane hydration and less resistance to oxygen transport are required for improved performance of PEFC, operated at elevated temperatures. Hence, diffusion media, being a gateway for reactant and product water transport between the gas channel and catalyst layer, require optimization to ensure an improved PEFC performance at elevated temperatures. In the present study, a functional dependence of cell voltage on diffusion media properties is characterized and a two-dimensional single-phase, non-isothermal model is used to study the effect of diffusion media properties on the performance of fuel cell operated at 95$\deg$C. It was found that there exists an optimum value of effective diffusive length of diffusion media that provides peak performance. In addition, a functionally graded diffusion media design is proposed that provides a better performance than conventional diffusion media at elevated temperature operation.},

The model allows parallel computing, thus making it practical to perform well-resolved simulations for large computational domains. The model accounts for convective and diffusive transport and allows prediction of the concentration of species. Distributed heat generation associated with the electrochemical reaction in the cathode and anode is included in the model. The model solves for the electric and ionic potentials in the electrodes and membrane, and the local activation overpotential distribution is resolved, rather than assumed uniform, making it possible to predict the local current density distribution more accurately. Maximum current densities are predicted under the land areas as a result of the dominant influence of ohmic losses over concentration losses on the activity at the catalyst layer. A parametric analysis shows that substantially different spatial distributions can be obtained by varying the asymmetry parameter with no noticeable change in the global current density and polarization curve. Changing the conductivity radically alters the current distribution by changing the relative influence of ohmic to activation overpotentials.},

  Abstract                 = {Borosilicate glasses display a rich complexity of chemical behavior depending on the details of their composition and thermal history. Noted for their high chemical durability and thermal shock resistance, borosilicate glasses have found a variety of important uses from common household and laboratory glassware to high-tech applications such as liquid crystal displays. In this paper, we investigate the topological principles of borosilicate glass chemistry covering the extremes from pure borate to pure silicate end members. Based on NMR measurements, we present a two-state statistical mechanical model of boron speciation in which addition of network modifiers leads to a competition between the formation of nonbridging oxygen and the conversion of boron from trigonal to tetrahedral configuration. Using this model, we derive a detailed topological representation of alkali-alkaline earth-borosilicate glasses that enables the accurate prediction of properties such as glass transition temperature, liquid fragility, and hardness. The modeling approach enables an understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing macroscopic properties. The implications of the glass topology are discussed in terms of both the temperature and thermal history dependence of the atomic bond constraints and the influence on relaxation behavior. We also observe a nonlinear evolution of the jump in isobaric heat capacity at the glass transition when substituting SiO(2) for B(2)O(3), which can be accurately predicted using a combined topological and thermodynamic modeling approach.},

  abstract = {Understanding fundamental electrochemical characteristics of industrial fluids, lubricants and their contaminants will allow for improvements in monitoring the performance of existent, and the formulation of new advanced industrial fluids and lubricants. This study focusses on the electrochemical characterization of model systems of colloidal dispersions of carbon black (CB), validation of these models, and investigation of applications of electrochemistry for determining the relative effectiveness of dispersants. Utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of industrial colloidal dispersions, an experimental method was developed to study the mechanism of dispersant/carbon black interactions, and the role of these interactions in the formation and stabilization of colloidal dispersions. Experimental EIS parameters such as conductivity, permittivity, critical frequencies of impedance and modulus relaxations, and impedance and modulus values were used in modeling equations describing particle sizes and interaction mechanisms occurring in CB dispersions. Results from the modeling equations show that dispersant micelles averaging 9 nm in diameter were present in solution. The dispersant micelles have a tendency to aggregate and form a loose "network". In solutions containing CB, dispersants surround CB particles and form a colloidal suspension. An increase in relative concentration of the dispersant leads to a better stability of the suspension and prevents CB agglomeration. The diameter of the suspended CB particles decreases with added dispersant until a stabilization point is reached at approximately 200 nm. The validity of the impedance data and results of the modeling equations were confirmed by other analytical techniques, such as quasi-elastic light scattering and adsorption analysis. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {A few hundred ppm of water can cause detrimental changes in the lubricating properties of engine oil. Electrochemical sensors based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were utilized to detect water leaks and continuously monitor the time dependent dynamics of water-oil interactions following the injection of water into industrial lubricant. Immediately following the injection, water molecules interacted with the oil additives (surfactants) forming a water-in-oil emulsion based on inverse micelles. Emulsification was followed by gradual loss of water from the solution through evaporation and electrolysis. On-line data were used to characterize the dynamics of water micellization, evaporation, and electrolysis. The values of kinetic rate constants and diffusion coefficients for the components of the water/oil system were determined. In order to support the experimental data and establish the kinetics of water-oil interactions, literature equations describing these interactions were adopted to develop a computational analysis model. The model illustrated the processes occurring in the water/oil system and resulted in an increased understanding of the recorded experimental data. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract  = {We study the effect of an inert supporting electrolyte on the steady-state ionic current through galvanic cells by solving the full Poisson--Nernst--Planck transport equation coupled to the generalized Frumkin--Butler--Volmer boundary equation for the electrochemical charge transfer at the electrodes. Consequently, the model presented here allows for non-zero space charge densities locally at the electrodes, thus extending the frequently used models based on the local electroneutrality condition by including diffuse layer (DL) effects. This extension is necessary since the DLs determine the ion concentration and electrical field at the reaction planes, which uniquely determine the charge transfer at the electrodes. In this work we present numerical results for systems which contain added inert supporting electrolyte using finite element discretization and compare those with semi-analytical results obtained using singular perturbation theory (limit of negligibly thin DLs). In case of negligibly thin DLs the presence of supporting electrolyte will introduce a limiting current below the classical diffusion-limiting current. Just as for systems without supporting electrolyte, the supporting electrolyte induced limiting current formally does not occur for systems having non-negligibly thin double DLs. For thin, however still finite, double layers this limit can still be seen as a steepening of the polarization curve for current vs. voltage.},

  abstract  = {A one-dimensional, non-isothermal, two-phase transient model has been developed to study the transient behaviour of water transport in the cathode gas diffusion layer of PEM fuel cells. The effects of four parameters, namely the liquid water saturation at the interface of the gas diffusion layer and flow channels, the proportion of liquid water to all of the water at the interface of the cathode catalyst layer and the gas diffusion layer, the current density, and the contact or wetting angle, on the transient distribution of liquid water saturation in the cathode gas diffusion layer are investigated. Especially, the time needed for liquid water saturation to reach steady state and the liquid water saturation at the interface of the cathode catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer are plotted as functions of the above four parameters. The ranges of water vapour condensation and liquid water evaporation are identified across the thickness of the gas diffusion layer. In addition, the effects of the above four parameters on the steady state distributions of gas phase pressure, water vapour concentration, oxygen concentration and temperature are also presented. It is found that increasing any one of the first three parameters will increase the water saturation at the interface of the catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer, but decrease the time needed for the liquid water saturation to reach steady state. When the liquid water saturation at the interface of the gas diffusion layer and flow channels is high enough ($\geq$0.1), the liquid water saturation at steady state is almost uniformly distributed across the thickness of the gas diffusion layer. It is also found that, under the given initial and boundary conditions in this paper, evaporation takes place within the gas diffusion layer close to the channel side and is the major process for water phase change at low current density (<2000Am$-$2); condensation occurs close to the catalyst layer side within the gas diffusion layer and dominates the phase change at high current density (>5000Am$-$2). For hydrophilic gas diffusion layers, both the time needed for liquid water saturation to reach steady state and the water saturation at the interface of the catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer will increase when the contact angle increases; but for hydrophobic gas diffusion layers, both of them decrease when the contact angle increases.},

Another theoretical equation, the Nernst-Einstein equation, was, likewise, used to determine the hydrodynamic radii of the considered ions in this work. ?? 2010 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

In this model we employ water diffusion coefficients electro-osmotic drag coefficients, water sorption isotherms, and membrane conductivities, all measured in our laboratory as functions of membrane water content. The model predicts a net-water-per-proton flux ratio of 0.2 Formula under typical operating conditions, which is much less than the measured electro-osmotic drag coefficient for a fully hydrated membrane. It also predicts an increase in membrane resistance with increased current density and demonstrates the great advantage of a thinner membrane in alleviating this resistance problem. Both of these predictions were verified experimentally under certain conditions.},

  abstract  = {Two methods of humidifying the anode gas, namely, external and membrane humidification, for a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel (PEMFC) cell are explained. It is found that the water of solvation of protons decreases with increase in the current density and the electrode area. This is due to insufficient external humidification. In a membrane-based humidification, an optimum set of parameters, such as gas flow rate, area and type of the membrane, must be chosen to achieve effective humidification. The present study examines the dependence of water pick-up by hydrogen on the temperature, area and thickness of the membrane in membrane humidification. Since the performance of the fuel cell is dependent more on hydrogen humidification than on oxygen humidification, the scope of the work is restricted to the humidification of hydrogen using Nafion{\textregistered} membrane. An examination is made on the dependence of water pick-up by hydrogen in membrane humidification on the temperature, area and thickness of the membrane. The dependence of fuel cell performance on membrane humidification and external humidification in the anode gas is also considered.},

  Abstract                 = {The potential-dependences of the rate constants associated with heterogeneous electron transfer predicted by the empirically based Butler-Volmer and fundamentally based Marcus-Hush formalisms are well documented for dc cyclic voltammetry. However, differences are often subtle, so, presumably on the basis of simplicity, the Butler-Volmer method is generally employed in theoretical-experimental comparisons. In this study, the ability of Large Amplitude Fourier Transform AC Cyclic Voltammetry to distinguish the difference in behaviour predicted by the two formalisms has been investigated. The focus of this investigation is on the difference in the profiles of the first to sixth harmonics, which are readily accessible when a large amplitude of the applied ac potential is employed. In particular, it is demonstrated that systematic analysis of the higher order harmonic responses in suitable kinetic regimes provides predicted deviations of Marcus-Hush from Butler-Volmer behaviour to be established from a single experiment under conditions where the background charging current is minimal.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract During the discharge process of non-aqueous lithium-air batteries, a solid product, Li2O2, forms in the pores of the porous cathode, and eventually causes the discharge process to cease. During the charge process, solid Li2O2 needs to be electrochemically oxidized. The morphology of the discharge product is, therefore, critically related to the capacity and reversibility of the battery. In this work, we experimentally show that for a given design of the cathode, the shape of the discharge product Li2O2 at a given discharge current density remains almost unchanged with a change in the operating temperature, but the size decreases with an increase in the temperature. We also demonstrate that the product shape varies with the discharge current density at a given temperature. The practical implication of these findings is that the capacity, charge voltage, and cyclability of a given non-aqueous lithium-air battery are affected by the operating temperature.},

It was found that the mixture of Pd and mesoporous ??-MnO2 electrode shows the high activity to oxidation and reduction of Li to form Li2O2 or Li 2O. Application of Pd/mesoporous ??-MnO2, which is mixed with teflonized acetylene binder (TAB), for air electrode is effective for decreasing the charge potential and also improved the energy efficiency as well as cyclability. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular dynamics simulations are becoming increasingly useful for gaining atomic-scale insight into the structure and reactivity of aqueous interfaces in the atmosphere. Here we review simulation studies of atmospherically relevant aqueous liquid-air interfaces, with an emphasis on ions that play important roles in the chemistry of atmospheric aerosols. In addition to surveying results from simulation studies, we discuss challenges to the refinement and experimental validation of the methodology for simulating ion adsorption to the air-water interface and recent advances in elucidating the driving forces for adsorption. We also review the recent development of a dielectric continuum theory capable of reproducing simulation and experimental data on ion behavior at aqueous interfaces.},

  abstract  = {For many years, polyaniline films have appeared to be one of the most studied conducting polymers. At the same time, ac-electrogravimetry has been used as a powerful technique for different polymer films but in general for slow perturbation rates. Two reasons for that: on the one hand, high frequency mass transfer responses are not expected and on the other hand, the electronic interfaces dedicated for ac-electrogravimetry are not prepared to follow, without distortion, high rate frequency shifts, faster than a few hertz. This paper shows that high ionic transfer responses can be detected by using a new ac-electrogravimetry concept. The experiments conducted with PANI tried to verify whether high frequency responses in conducting polymers are possible or not. The main interest of the new device is to reach the high frequency values directly and to demonstrate an ionic transfer contribution at 1 kHz which was not predicted with old systems. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The thickness profile leads to a well-defined minimum in the calculated phase angle curves, which can be observed in the high frequency domain. This effect is enhanced with higher permittivity, thinner coatings and low conductivity immersion baths. From these results, it appears that the graphical treatment of experimental phase angle curves to evaluate the coating degradation may lead to erroneous conclusions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Redox characteristics of the dissolved oxygen and its reduction products in the presence of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) supporting electrolyte were studied via cyclic, rotating disk (RDE) and ring-disk (RRDE) electrode voltammetry. The DMSO medium facilitates reversible reduction and oxidation processes in contrast to other solvent-based electrolytes studied. Galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling of the Li-O2 cells has shown characteristics of rechargeability expected from voltammetric studies. Multiple high-efficiency discharge-charge cycles are possible if the depth of discharge of the carbon cathode is limited to avoid excessive passivation by the discharge products. The discharge voltage of this Li-O2 cell is higher than cells assembled with other non-aqueous organic electrolytes, an attribute ascribed to the stability of superoxide (O2{$-$}), the one-electron reduction product of oxygen.},

  abstract  = {It has become clear that cycling lithium-oxygen cells in carbonate electrolytes is impractical, as electrolyte decomposition, triggered by oxygen reduction products, dominates the cell chemistry. This research shows that employing an $\alpha$-MnO2/ramsdellite-MnO2 electrode/electrocatalyst results in the formation of lithium-oxide-like discharge products in propylene carbonate, which has been reported to be extremely susceptible to decomposition. X-ray photoelectron data have shown that what are likely lithium oxides (Li2O2 and Li2O) appear to form and decompose on the air electrode surface, particularly at the MnO2 surface, while Li2CO3 is also formed. By contrast, cells without $\alpha$-MnO2/ramsdellite-MnO2 fail rapidly in electrochemical cycling, likely due to the differences in the discharge product. Relatively high electrode capacities, up to 5000 mAh/g (carbon + electrode/electrocatalyst), have been achieved with non-optimized air electrodes. Insights into reversible insertion reactions of lithium, lithium peroxide (Li2O2) and lithium oxide (Li2O) in the tunnels of $\alpha$-MnO2, and the reaction of lithium with ramsdellite-MnO2, as determined by first principles density functional theory calculations, are used to provide a possible explanation for some of the observed results. It is speculated that a Li2O-stabilized and partially-lithiated electrode component, 0.15Li2O$\cdot$$\alpha$-LixMnO2, that has Mn4+/3+ character may facilitate the Li2O2/Li2O discharge/charge chemistries providing dual electrode/electrocatalyst functionality.},

A commercial catalyst-coated membrane with an active area of 25cm2 is used along with a GDL and an MPL for assembling a single cell. The effects of the MPL, the thickness of the MPL, the PTFE loading of carbon paper and MPL, and the baking time of the MPL have been investigated. Results show that the addition of MPL increases cell performance in the high current density region due to the elimination of mass transfer limitation. There exists an optimum thickness of MPL. Furthermore, increasing the MPL baking time enhances cell performance due to enlarged pore size and permeability.},

  Abstract                 = {Li--O2 (or Li--air) battery currently represents a hot topic in the field of energy storage and conversion. The electrochemical performance of Li--O2 battery depends largely on the material and architecture of the catalytic cathode. In this work, we propose a unique design of binder-free catalytic cathode for Li--O2 batteries. The electrode consists of novel mushroom-like Au/NiCo2O4 nanohybrid on three-dimensional graphene (3D-G) grown directly on the skeleton of Ni foam. The Au/NiCo2O4/3D-G catalyst exhibits good catalytic effect for Li--O2 batteries, where Au directs the growth of Li2O2 mainly on the top of mushroom-like Au/NiCo2O4, and induces the crystallization of Li2O2 into thin-flake or thin-film form that is found to decompose relatively easily compared with large-particle form upon charge. Mushroom-like NiCo2O4 provides additional catalytic sites and acts as the support for both Au and Li2O2. Li--O2 battery with Au/NiCo2O4/3D-G catalyst can deliver a capacity of around 1275 mAh g--1 at 42.5 mA g--1. When the capacity is limited at 510 mAh g--1, the Li--O2 battery can sustain a stable cycling for 40 times.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a first approximation to the theoretical analysis of fractal-like electrodes for lithium-ion batteries, and demonstrates that fractals constitute an optimal electrode configuration for electrochemical energy storage systems. The model considers a generalized description of three-dimensional, non-deterministic branching structures composed of cylindrical elements for the electrode design. Each element is attached to a branch in an iterative process. At every branching step, the "parent" branch divides into N "child" branches (N being a random variable with a defined probability distribution). At the same time, the dimensions of the radii and lengths of the branches are also determined by a stochastic process. With this model, the charge characteristics of several fractal electrodes corresponding to different geometric configurations are simulated, and the optimal parameters are obtained. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The direct imaging of electrochemical processes at high spatial resolution and within their native liquid electrolyte would significantly enhance our understanding of device functionality, but has remained elusive. In this work we use a recently developed liquid cell for in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy to obtain insight into the electrolyte decomposition mechanisms and kinetics in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries by characterizing the dynamics of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and evolution. Here we are able to visualize the detailed structure of the SEI that forms locally at the electrode/electrolyte interface during lithium intercalation into natural graphite from an organic Li-ion battery electrolyte. We quantify the SEI growth kinetics and observe the dynamic self-healing nature of the SEI with changes in cell potential.},

The C(Mo2C) carbon supports with variable specific surface area, microporosity-mesoporosity, good electrical conductivity and corrosion stability at positive potentials were prepared from Mo2C at 600 $\deg$C and 800 $\deg$C using chlorination synthesis method. Pt-nanoclusters were deposited onto/into carbons using sodium borohydride reduction method. XRD, XRF, XPS, SEM-EDX, and HRTEM data confirm that catalysts under study are free from chlorine, chloride ions, and other residuals of raw materials, and have highly porous hierarchical structure with homogenously dispersed Pt-nanoclusters. RDE data show that the kinetic current densities are higher and half-wave potentials are more positive for Pt-C(Mo 2C)800 $\deg$C than for Pt-C(Mo2C)600 $\deg$C in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The limiting diffusion currents are independent of the catalyst composition used due to the proceeding of ORR process in the outer-diffusion mode. Analysis of impedance data demonstrated nearly capacitive behaviour in low ac frequency region, explained by quick cathodic electroreduction of oxygen followed by slow electrical double-layer formation step limited by adsorption of ions and intermediates at/inside microporous-mesoporous C(Mo2C) and Pt-nanocluster modified electrodes. High series and parallel capacitance values (100-250 F g -1) have been established, attractive also for hybrid supercapacitor applications. High frequency series resistance values are higher for more amorphous C(Mo2C)600 $\deg$C than for C(Mo2C)800 $\deg$C supported electrode. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Gas and water management are key to achieving good performance from a PEM fuel cell stack. Previous experimentation had found, and this experimentation confirms, that one very effective method of achieving proper gas and water management is the use of an Interdigitated flow field design. However, the results of a single fuel cell with an Interdigitated flow field could not be extended to a multi-cell stack because of the inability to establish uniform gas flow to each individual cell. Since the interdigitated flow field uses the flow of gas for excess water removal, a deficient flow of gas causes the cell to become flooded. To alleviate this problem of unequal gas distribution, a method of sequentially exhausting each individual cell was developed. This method controls each cell{\textquoteright}s exhaust so that only one cell at any given time has an open exhaust port, thereby, ensuring gas will flow through that cell. By sequentially exhausting each cell, it will be ensured that the gas will flow to each cell and provide the water management necessary to achieve good performance. This was demonstrated in a three-cell PEM stack with interdigitated flow fields operating at ambient pressure and temperature on neat hydrogen and oxygen. The results showed that the use of sequential exhaust control improved the peak power from 0.26W/cm2 per cell without exhaust control to 0.50W/cm2 per cell, a doubling of the power density.},

For the atomically flat electrodes the electrolyte was observed to form a multilayer structure near the electrode described by exponentially decaying sinusoidal oscillations in ion and charge densities perpendicular to the electrode/electrolyte interface. The differential EDL capacitance vs. electrode potential was found to exhibit "U-shaped" behavior while the EDL capacitance exhibited complex dependence on electrode potential including regions of negative capacitance near zero electrode potential. Increased capacitance and an enhanced degree of electrode-electrolyte interface structure were observed with decreasing temperature. For nanoporous electrodes with both slit and cylindrical pore geometries, the electrolyte was observed to form highly structured alternating charged layers within the electrode nanopores. A maximum in the normalized (per unit electrode area) EDL capacitance was found for pore widths that accommodate several charged layers inside the pores. The observed dependence of capacitance on pore size appears to be a compromise between increasing structure/charge imbalance and decreasing ion density with decreasing pore width/diameter.},

We also show data for fully packaged Li-Air cells that achieve more than 800 Wh/kg. {\^{A}}{\copyright} 2014 The Author(s).},

  Abstract                 = {Metal oxides are attractive candidates for low cost, earth-abundant electrocatalysts. However, owing to their insulating nature, their wide-spread application has been limited. Nanostructuring offers a way around by enabling tunneling as a possible charge transport mechanism. Using TiO2 as a model system for oxygen evolution reaction, our theoretical analysis points to a critical thickness about \~{} 4 nm at a current density of \~{}1 mA/cm(2). This is corroborated by electrochemical measurements on conformal thin films synthesized using atomic layer deposition (ALD) identifying a similar critical thickness. Finally, we generalize the theoretical analysis deriving a relation between the critical thickness and the location of valence band maximum relative to the limiting potential of the electrochemical surface process. The critical thickness sets the optimum size of the nano-particle oxide electrocatalyst and this provides an important nano-structuring requirement for metal oxide electrocatalyst design.},

  abstract  = {Non-aqueous Li-air or Li-O(2) cells show considerable promise as a very high energy density battery couple. Such cells, however, show sudden death at capacities far below their theoretical capacity and this, among other problems, limits their practicality. In this paper, we show that this sudden death arises from limited charge transport through the growing Li(2)O(2) film to the Li(2)O(2)-electrolyte interface, and this limitation defines a critical film thickness, above which it is not possible to support electrochemistry at the Li(2)O(2)-electrolyte interface. We report both electrochemical experiments using a reversible internal redox couple and a first principles metal-insulator-metal charge transport model to probe the electrical conductivity through Li(2)O(2) films produced during Li-O(2) discharge. Both experiment and theory show a "sudden death" in charge transport when film thickness is ~5 to 10 nm. The theoretical model shows that this occurs when the tunneling current through the film can no longer support the electrochemical current. Thus, engineering charge transport through Li(2)O(2) is a serious challenge if Li-O(2) batteries are ever to reach their potential.},

We emphasize methods based on use of self-assembled colloidal templates (e.g., surfactants or nanoparticles), around which the materials of interest are formed.

  Abstract                 = {A major challenge in the development of rechargeable Li-O(2) batteries is the identification of electrolyte materials that are stable in the operating environment of the O(2) electrode. Straight-chain alkyl amides are one of the few classes of polar, aprotic solvents that resist chemical degradation in the O(2) electrode, but these solvents do not form a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li anode. The lack of a persistent SEI leads to rapid and sustained solvent decomposition in the presence of Li metal. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time successful cycling of a Li anode in the presence of the solvent, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), by employing a salt, lithium nitrate (LiNO(3)), that stabilizes the SEI. A Li-O(2) cell containing this electrolyte composition is shown to cycle for more than 2000 h (>80 cycles) at a current density of 0.1 mA/cm(2) with a consistent charging profile, good capacity retention, and O(2) detected as the primary gaseous product formed during charging. The discovery of an electrolyte system that is compatible with both electrodes in a Li-O(2) cell may eliminate the need for protecting the anode with a ceramic membrane.},

The effects of temperature and time on chloromethylation of the polymer were investigated and the chloromethylation was optimized. Furthermore, different approaches for quaternization of the synthesized chloromethylated polymer were studied. The results show that both temperature and time exhibited significant impacts on chloromethylation and gelation. It was also found that using an appropriate quaternization approach could significantly improve the ionic conductivity and also could optimize the conductivity of the membrane even though the accessible functional chloromethyl groups were limited. The developed AAEM showed the ionic conductivity up to 3.1 ?? 10 -2 S/cm at room temperature. Increasing temperature increased the ionic conductivity up to 7.33 ?? 10 -2 S/cm. The formed AAEM was stable in a concentrated base up to 8.0 M KOH at room temperature. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Experiments with different fuel cell operating temperatures, different cathode and anode humidification temperatures, different operating pressures, and various combinations of these parameters have been carried out. The experimental results are presented in the form of polarization curves, which show the effects of the various operating parameters on the performance of the PEM fuel cell. The possible mechanisms of the parameter effects and their interrelationships are discussed. In addition, a comprehensive three-dimensional fuel cell model is briefly presented and the modeling results are compared with our experimental data.

The HyLAB has sulfuric acid as the catholyte and a large active electrode area (10 cm 2). The active cathode layer was made from a buckypaper with 5 wt.\% Pt supported on carbon nanotubes (Pt/CNTs) for oxygen reduction and evolution. A similar cathode was constructed with a catalyst of 5 wt.\% Pt supported on carbon black (Pt/CB). It is demonstrated that sulfuric acid can achieve high discharging current densities while maintaining relatively high cell potentials. The cell with Pt/CNTs showed a much better performance than with Pt/CB at high current densities. The HyLAB with Pt/CNTs achieved a discharging capacity of 306 mAh/g and a cell voltage of 3.15 V at 0.2 mA/cm 2. The corresponding specific energy is 1067 Wh/kg based on the total weight of the sulfuric acid. Slow decrease in performance was observed, but it can be recovered by refilling the cell with new electrolyte after continuous discharging of more than 75 h. A charge-discharge experiment at 0.2 mA/cm 2 showed that the cell was rechargeable with a capacity of more than 300 mAh/g. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is based on the response analysis with frequency to a sine wave potential modulation applied to an electrode, of a Raman band, the intensity of which is proportional to the response of surface concentration of an adsorbed species. A set-up, consisting of a Raman spectrometer with a CCD detector from which the Raman intensity was defined and extracted to be converted into a tension sent to the input of a multichannel FRA, was implemented. The procedure for extracting the Raman band intensity is explained and was validated by using, as a substitute to the Raman band, a LED light. The method was applied to the study of the polyaniline doping process in a pH range around 3. Five input channels of the FRA were devoted to Raman bands characterizing leucoemeraldine, emeraldine base and/or salt. For pH lower than 3, the concentrations of all moieties are in phase with the charge, while above 3, emeraldine base shows a significant phase lag. This behavior is consistent with a model in progress involving two electrochemical steps and a chemical one. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Discharge products such as Li 2O 2 or Li 2CO 3 are insoluble in several major nonaqueous electrolytes, and consequently precipitate at the reaction sites. These materials are also low in electric conductivity. As a result, the reduced pore space and electrode passiviation increase the reaction resistance and consequently reduce discharge voltage and capability. This work presents a modeling study of discharge product precipitation and effects for lithium-air batteries. Theoretical analysis is also performed to evaluate the variations of important quantities including temperature, species concentrations, and electric potentials. Precipitation growth modes on planar, cylindrical and spherical surfaces are discussed. A new approach, following the study of ice formation in PEM fuel cells, is proposed.

  Abstract                 = {Due to its higher electrical conductivity compared with carbon and its outstanding corrosion resistance, titanium nitride (TiN) has recently been studied intensively for applications as an active electrode as well as catalyst support materials in supercapacitors, fuel cells and Li-air batteries. In this work, we studied the electrocatalytic activities of nano- and micro-sized TiN toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline media using a thin film-rotating-disk electrode (RDE) technique, and investigated their performances as active air electrodes on a newly developed Li-air fuel cell with a hybrid electrolyte. The results show that both nano- and micro-sized TiN exhibit electrocatalytic activities toward ORR in alkaline media but with different mechanisms. The ORR catalyzed by micro-sized TiN proceeds via the serial "2e- + 2e-" pathway in a consecutive manner with the reduction of HO2- starting at a higher electrode potential as a discrete step. On the other hand, the ORR catalyzed by nano-sized TiN proceeds via a dual-path, where the two serial "2e-" steps proceed with smaller intervals and manifest an overall mixed appearance by coexistence of the parallel and serial "2e-" steps. The extent to which the two steps are in parallel or consecutive reveals a potential-dependent feature. Furthermore, both nano- and micro-sized TiN particles demonstrate evident electrocatalytic activities toward ORR in the Li-air fuel cell, with the nano-sized TiN showing a much better catalytic activity, which is comparable to that of the nano-sized Mn3O4.},

  Abstract                 = {With the development of renewable energy and electrified transportation, electrochemical energy storage will be more important in the future than it has ever been in the past. Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are traditionally considered to be the most likeliest candidate thanks to their relatively long cycle life and high energy efficiency, their limited energy density as well as cost are still causing a bottleneck for their long-term application. Alternatively, metal-air batteries have been proposed as a very promising large-scale electricity storage technology with the replacement of the intercalation reaction mechanism by the catalytic redox reaction of a light weight metal-oxygen couple. Generally, based on the electrolyte, these metal-air batteries can be divided into aqueous and nonaqueous systems, corresponding to two typical batteries of Zn-air and Li-air, respectively. The prominent feature of both batteries are their extremely high theoretical energy density, especially for nonaqueous Li-air batteries, which far exceeds the best that can be achieved with LIBs. In this review, we focus on the major obstacle of sluggish kinetics of the cathode in both batteries, and summarize the fundamentals and recent advances related to the oxygen catalyst materials. According to the electrolyte, the aqueous and nonaqueous electrocatalytic mechanisms of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are discussed. Subsequently, seven groups of oxygen catalysts, which have played catalytic roles in both systems, are selectively reviewed, including transition metal oxides (single-metal oxides and mixed-metal oxides), functional carbon materials (nanostructured carbons and doped carbons), metal oxide-nanocarbon hybrid materials, metal-nitrogen complexes (non-pyrolyzed and pyrolyzed), transition metal nitrides, conductive polymers, and precious metals (alloys). Nonaqueous systems have the advantages of energy density and rechargeability over aqueous systems and have gradually become the research focus of metal-air batteries. However, there are considerable challenges beyond catalysts from aqueous to nonaqueous electrolytes, which are also discussed in this review. Finally, several future research directions are proposed based on the results achieved in this field, with emphasis on nonaqueous Li-air batteries.},

  Abstract                 = {In this review, we have examined the different models for polymer-electrolyte fuel cells operating with hydrogen. The major focus has been on transport of the various species within the fuel cell. The different regions of the fuel cell were examined, and their modeling methodologies and equations were elucidated. In particular, the 1-D fuel-cell sandwich was discussed thoroughly because it is the most important part of the fuel-cell assembly. Models that included other effects such as temperature gradients and transport in other directions besides through the fuel-cell sandwich were also discussed. Models were not directly compared to each other; instead they were broken down into their constitutive parts. The reason for this is that validation of the models is usually accomplished by comparison of simulation to experimental polarization data (e.g., Figure 3). However, other data can also be used such as the net flux of water through the membrane. In fitting these data, the models vary not only in their complexity and treatments but also in their number and kind of fitting parameters. This is one reason it is hard to justify one approach over another by just looking at the modeling results. In general, it seems reasonable that the more complex models, which are based on physical arguments and do not contain many fitting parameters, are perhaps closest to reality. Of course, this assumes that they fit the experimental data and observations. This last point has been overlooked in the validation of many models. For example, a model may fit the data very well for certain operating conditions, but if it does not at least predict the correct trend when one of those conditions is changed, then the model is shown to be valid only within a certain operating range. This review has highlighted the important effects that should be modeled. These include two-phase flow of liquid water and gas in the fuel-cell sandwich, a robust membrane model that accounts for the different membrane transport modes, nonisothermal effects, especially in the directions perpendicular to the sandwich, and multidimensional effects such as changing gas composition along the channel, among others. For any model, a balance must be struck between the complexity required to describe the physical reality and the additional costs of such complexity. In other words, while more complex models more accurately describe the physics of the transport processes, they are more computationally costly and may have so many unknown parameters that their results are not as meaningful. Hopefully, this review has shown and broken down for the reader the vast complexities of transport within polymer-electrolyte fuel cells and the various ways they have been and can be modeled.},

  abstract  = {Constant-current discharge curves for the nickel hydroxide electrode are simulated assuming resistances due to diffusion of protons and conduction of electrons through the nickel hydroxide film, and charge-transfer resistance at the film/electrolyte interface contribute to the polarization losses of the electrode. Good qualitative agreement is observed between the model predictions and experimental discharge curves. The results suggest that polarization losses due to diffusional limitations of protons is a critical factor in determining the characteristics of the discharge curve. Ohmic resistance has a significant effect on the discharge curves at the end of discharge, and charge-transfer resistance is a minor contributor to the polarization losses. These findings indicate that accurately measuring the diffusion coefficient of protons, the thickness of the hydroxide film, the initial state-of-charge, and the electronic conductivity as a function of state-of-charge towards the end of discharge are critical in accurately predicting the discharge characteristics of nickel hydroxide. Physical constants which were shown to have minor influence on the discharge curves are the film conductivity at the beginning of discharge, and the exchange current density and cathodic transfer coefficient for the reaction. The time-dependent, one-dimensional diffusion equation has been solved analytically which should provide a computationally efficient means of accounting for proton diffusion and variable electronic conductivity in a macrohomogeneous battery model without sacrificing accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) electrochemical reaction is of importance to improve reaction kinetics, efficiency, and mitigate parasitic reactions, which links to the strategy of enhanced Li-O2 battery performance. Many in situ and ex situ analyses have been reported to address chemical species of reduction intermediate and products, whereas details of the dynamic Li-O2 reaction have not as yet been fully unraveled. For this purpose, visual imaging can provide straightforward evidence, formation and decomposition of products, during the Li-O2 electrochemical reaction. Here, we present real-time and in situ views of the Li-O2 reaction using electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM). Details of the reaction process can be observed at nano-/micrometer scale on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) electrode with lithium ion-containing tetraglyme, representative of the carbon cathode and ether-based electrolyte extensively employed in the Li-O2 battery. Upon oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), rapid growth of nanoplates, having axial diameter of hundreds of nanometers, length of micrometers, and \~{}5 nm thickness, at a step edge of HOPG can be observed, which eventually forms a lithium peroxide (Li2O2) film. This Li2O2 film is decomposed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), for which the decomposition potential is related to a thickness. There is no evidence of byproduct analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after first reduction and oxidation reaction. However, further cycles provide unintended products such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium acetate, and fluorine-related species with irregular morphology due to the degradation of HOPG electrode, tetraglyme, and lithium salt. These observations provide the first visualization of Li-O2 reaction process and morphological information of Li2O2, which can allow one to build strategies to prepare the optimum conditions for the Li-O2 battery.},

High performances are achieved with loadings as low as 0.12 mg Pt cm$-$2 at the cathode and even lower loadings are required at the anode. However, the long-term performance of these fuel cells depends upon the structural integrity of the recast, ionomer-bound catalyst layers. The discovery that the inclusion of large cations through a simple ion-exchange process renders perfluorosulfonate ionomers moderately melt-processable is exploited to significantly improve the structural integrity of the catalyst layers. When the thermoplastic form of the solubilized ionomer is used in the membrane catalyzation process, the reproducibility is greatly improved and the long-term performance losses are quite low. Overall, the fuel cells demonstrate less than 10\% loss in maximum power over almost 4000 h. An indication of the durability of the catalyst layer and the integrity of the catalyst layer/membrane interface is provided by the high tolerance of such fuel cells to shut-down/start-up and freeze-thaw cycles. Various other aspects of endurance testing and overall operation of such PEFCs are also discussed.},

Suitable catalysts reduce overpotentials during the charge and discharge process, and therefore improve the round-trip efficiency of the battery. In this case, the electrodes will be used as optimized cathodes for a future lithium-air battery with an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Oxide catalysts were synthesized via atmospheric plasma spraying. The screening showed that IrO, RuO, LaCaCo, MnO, and CoO are promising bi-functional catalysts. Considering the high price for the noble metal catalysts further investigations of the oxide catalysts were carried out to analyze their electrochemical behavior at varied temperatures, molarities, and in case of LaCaCoO a varying calcium content. Additionally all catalysts were tested in a longterm test to proof cyclability at varied molarities. Further investigations showed that CoO seems to be the most promising bi-functional catalyst of the tested oxide catalysts. Furthermore, it was shown that a calcium content of x = 0.4 in LCCO has the best performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

A model for heat and water transport in a polymer membrane fuel cell has been developed for evaluation with regard to structure and material. Moreover the dynamic simulation allows simulation of the transient state after changes of electrical load or gas flow rate and humidification. The polymer membrane fuel cell is subdivided into different components: gas distributor, gas diffusion layer, catalytic layer and membrane. Each of these components is described by a mathematical model which accounts for the physical phenomena arising in this structure: i.e. energy and mass transfer and electrochemical kinetics. In the simulation program each component is represented by a separate module. Coupling these modules results in a model describing a single electrode membrane unit or a complete fuel cell stack. Results are presented by current-voltage curves or temperature plots. The influence of model parameters such as thickness and porosity of the diffusion layer, or the structure of the catalytic layer, are shown. Furthermore, results of the dynamic behaviour of a polymer membrane fuel cell are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Lithium peroxide (Li2O2), the solid and intrinsically electronic insulating discharge product of Li-O2 batteries strongly influences the discharge and charge kinetics. In a series of experiments, we investigated the growth of Li2O2 upon discharge and the corresponding reduction and oxidation processes by varying the depth of discharge. The results indicate that insulating Li2O2 particles with a disc-like shape were formed during the initial discharge stage. Afterward, the nucleation and growth of Li2O2 resulted in the formation of conducting Li2O2 shells. When the discharge voltage dropped below 2.65 V, the Li2O2 discs evolved to toroid-shaped particles and defective superoxide-like phase presumably with high conductivity was formed on the rims of Li2O2 toroids. Both Li2O2 and the superoxide-like phase are unstable in ether-based electrolytes resulting in the degradation of the corresponding cells. Nevertheless, by controlling the growth of Li2O2, the chemical reactivity of the discharge product can be suppressed to improve the reversibility of Li-O2 batteries.},

We demonstrate that a novel air electrode consisting of an unusual hierarchical arrangement of functionalized graphene sheets (with no catalyst) delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 15000 mAh/g in lithium-O(2) batteries which is the highest value ever reported in this field. This excellent performance is attributed to the unique bimodal porous structure of the electrode which consists of microporous channels facilitating rapid O(2) diffusion while the highly connected nanoscale pores provide a high density of reactive sites for Li-O(2) reactions. Further, we show that the defects and functional groups on graphene favor the formation of isolated nanosized Li(2)O(2) particles and help prevent air blocking in the air electrode. The hierarchically ordered porous structure in bulk graphene enables its practical applications by promoting accessibility to most graphene sheets in this structure.},

The bulk and surface structures of pristine and cycled samples of Li[Ni1/5Li1/5Mn3/5]O2 are characterized by synchrotron X-Ray diffraction together with aberration corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (a-S/TEM). Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) is carried out to investigate the surface changes of the samples before/after electrochemical cycling. Combining first principles computational investigation with our experimental observations, a detailed lithium de-intercalation mechanism is proposed for this family of Li-excess layered oxides. The most striking characteristics in these high voltage high energy density cathode materials are 1) formation of tetrahedral lithium ions at voltage less than 4.45 V and 2) the transition metal (TM) ions migration leading to phase transformation on the surface of the materials. We show clear evidence of a new spinel-like solid phase formed on the surface of the electrode materials after high-voltage cycling. It is proposed that such surface phase transformation is one of the factors contributing to the first cycle irreversible capacity and the main reason for the intrinsic poor rate capability of these materials.},

This measurement method enables investigating the effects of various design and geometric parameters as well as operating conditions, such as properties of cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL), membrane thickness, cell current density, cell temperature, methanol solution concentration, oxygen flow rate, etc., on water crossover through the membrane in situ in a DMFC. Water crossover through the membrane is generally due to electro-osmotic drag, diffusion and back convection. The experimental data showed that diffusion dominated the total water-crossover flux at low current densities due to the high water concentration difference across the membrane. With the increase in current density, the water flux by diffusion decreased, but the flux by back convection increased. The corresponding net water-transport coefficient was also found to decrease with current density. The experimental results also showed that the use of a hydrophobic cathode GDL with a hydrophobic MPL could substantially reduce water crossover through the membrane, and thereby significantly increasing the limiting current as the result of the improved oxygen transport. It was found that the cell operating temperature, oxygen flow rate and membrane thickness all had significant influences on water crossover, but the influence of methanol concentration was negligibly small.},

The experimental data showed that with the presence of a hydrophobic MPL in the GDL, the water-crossover flux through the membrane decreased slightly with increasing the PTFE loading in the BL. However, a higher PTFE loading in the BL not only lowered cell performance, but also resulted in an unstable discharging process. It was also found that the PTFE loading in the MPL had little effect on the water-crossover flux, but its effect on cell performance was substantial: the 40-wt\% PTFE loading in the MPL was found to be the optimal value to achieve the best performance. The experimental results further showed that increasing the carbon loading in the MPL significantly lowered the water-crossover flux, but a too high carbon loading would decrease the cell performance as the result of the increased oxygen transport resistance; the 2.0-mgCcm$-$2 carbon loading was found to exhibit the best performance.},

  Abstract                 = {This work is concerned with the determination of two critical constitutive properties for mass transport of ions through porous electrodes saturated with a liquid electrolyte solution. One is the effective diffusivity that is required to model the mass transport at the representative element volume (REV) level of porous electrodes in the framework of Darcy's law, while the other is the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient for modeling the mass transport from the REV level to the solid surfaces of pores induced by redox reactions. Based on the theoretical framework of mass transport through the electrodes of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), unique experimental setups for electrochemically determining the two transport properties by measuring limiting current densities are devised. The effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient through the porous electrode made of graphite felt, a typical material for VRFB electrodes, are measured at different electrolyte flow rates. The correlation equations, respectively, for the effective diffusivity and the pore-level mass-transfer coefficient are finally proposed based on the experimental data.},

The results reveal that the features of impedance spectra of the single intercalation particle and the mixed particles are the same and the features consist of lithium ion migration through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film (R(SEI)parallel to C(SEI) semicircle), an electron and ion transfer process (R(ct) parallel to C(dl) semicircle), and a finite-diffusion Warburg element. For the nonhomogeneous, multilayered porous electrodes model, a peculiar feature of impedance spectra is that a new arc appears in the Nyquist plot. A detailed analysis revealed that a different particle size distribution could lead to the appearance of a new arc and a different layer distribution (a thicker layer and a thinner layer), which could lead to a well-developed semicircle.},

A joint performance and cost optimization is carried out to demonstrate this new approach. This approach breaks the traditional barrier between design (concerning functional performance) and manufacturing (concerning production costs), allowing both functional performance and production costs to be fed into design phase and to be jointly optimized.},

Furthermore, N-doping can further decrease the energy barrier from 2.39 eV (undoped case) to 1.20 eV. The O2 molecule physical adsorption, O atom chemical adsorption at the graphene, and N-doped graphenesurfaces are also simulated.},

  abstract  = {In this work, the main theme is to study the effects of electrode fabrication processes and material parameters on cell performance of PEM fuel cell. Adding a micro porous layer to traditional gas diffusion layer (GDL) can enhance the ability of water management, and therefore achieve better cell performance and higher limiting current density. For the effects of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), either too high or too low content will deteriorate the performance of fuel cells. If the FEP content in the GDL is too high, indicating the GDL with a quite small pore size, the fuel gas will be difficult to diffuse in the GDL. If the content is too low, the water generated in the cell cannot be effectively removed. It is disclosed by the present experiments that when using air as cathode oxidant at an operating voltage above 0.6V, the best performance can be achieved by using a GDL with 10\% FEP content in the carbon paper and 20\% content in the micro porous layer. The Vulcan XC-72R carbon loading of 1mg/cm2 in the micro porous layer is sufficiently high to obtain the maximum performance.},

The emphasis of the analysis is placed on the effects of the cross-section of the channel of the anode flow distributor and the porosity of the gas-diffusion layer. By applying a two-dimensional mass transport model, the effects of the channel width fraction, $\lambda$={\ell}c/{\ell}b, the channel number, N, the porosity of the diffuser layer, $\epsilon$, and the surface overpotential of the catalyst layer, $\eta$, on the resultant current density are investigated. The cell performance is evaluated by the predicted voltage--current density curves. It is disclosed that an increase in either $\lambda$, N or $\epsilon$ may lead to a better cell performance. At relatively low overpotential, better uniformity in current density distribution along the width of the cell (x-direction) can be attained. Based on the present results, a correlation of overpotentials is proposed, namely, $\eta$cr=0.165$\lambda$0.0935N0.2033$\epsilon$0.0856, which may serve as a guideline to justify the validity of a simplified one-dimensional model.},

Herein we present evidence from Raman and magnetic measurements that the lower plateau corresponds to a form of lithium peroxide with superoxide-like properties characterized by a low temperature magnetic phase transition and a high O-O stretching frequency (1125 cm(-1)). The magnetic phase transition and the high O-O stretching frequency disappear when charged to above 3.7 V. Theoretical calculations indicate that a surface superoxide structure on lithium peroxide clusters and some lithium peroxide surfaces have an unpaired electron and a high O-O stretching frequency that help explain the observations. These results provide evidence that the form of the lithium peroxide discharge product is important to obtaining a low charge overpotential, and thus improving the round-trip efficiency between discharge and charge.},

  Abstract                 = {Reducing the energy loss associated with Li2O2 electrochemical oxidation is paramount to the development of efficient rechargeable lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries for practical use. The influence of a series of perovskites with different eg filling on the kinetics of Li2O2 oxidation was examined using Li2O2-prefilled electrodes. While LaCrO3 is inactive for oxygen evolution upon water oxidation in alkaline solution, it was found to provide the highest specific current towards Li2O2 oxidation among all the perovskites examined. Further exploration of Cr-based catalysts showed that Cr nanoparticles (Cr NP) with an average particle size of 40 nm, having oxidized surfaces, had comparable surface area activities to LaCrO3 but much greater mass activities. Unlike Pt/C and Ru/C that promote electrolyte oxidation in addition to Li2O2 oxidation, no evidence of enhanced electrolyte oxidation was found for Cr NP relative to Vulcan carbon. X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the O K and Cr L edge revealed a redox process of Cr(3+) {\^{a}}{\dag{}}{''} Cr(6+) on the surface of Cr NP upon Li2O2 oxidation, which might be responsible for the enhanced oxidation kinetics of Li2O2 and the reduced charging voltages of Li-O2 batteries.},

Here we present ruthenium oxide nanoparticles (RuO2 NPs) dispersed on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a cathode, which dramatically increase the electrical efficiency up to 73\%. We demonstrate that the RuO2 NPs contribute to the formation of poorly crystalline lithium peroxide (Li2O2) that is coated over the CNT with large contact area during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This unique Li2O2 structure can be smoothly decomposed at low potential upon oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by avoiding the energy loss associated with the decomposition of the more typical Li2O2 structure with a large size, small CNT contact area, and insulating crystals.},

Charge/discharge experiments showed that the rate dischargeability of the MnO2/AC capacitor with 1 M LiOH electrolyte is excellent, and the cyclic stability of the MnO2/AC capacitor with 1 M LiOH electrolyte is much better than that with 1 M KOH electrolyte. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {Increasing demand for energy, energy security and the need to minimize the impact on the environment related to energy are the major drivers for the research and development of alternative energy technologies. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising alternative technology. However, their performance, in other words efficiency, can be hindered severely by the presence of contaminants. Impurities in the oxidant and fuel feeds act as barriers to the oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation. These impurities arise from the use of atmospheric air as the oxidant and hydrogen from reformate as the fuel. The electrolyte membrane can be attacked by ions originating from the cell components. These ions decrease the mechanical and chemical stability of the membrane resulting in the decrease of proton conductivity and reactant crossover. Due to the severity of these poisoning phenomena, much work has been dedicated to understanding their chemical kinetics, their effects and mitigation methods. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the experimental, analytical and numerical work devoted to understanding the contamination of the cathode, electrolyte membrane and anode. A summary of future directions and research topics is also given.},

The potential/time bound electrochemical characterization at different discharge rates and depths is performed along with ex situ analyses using techniques such as X-ray diffraction and FESEM. Among the two different GDLs investigated, the one with standard microporous layer is promising as high capacity cathode. Cell charge/discharge capability was evaluated and the results strongly support a discharge mechanism which mainly involves Li2O2 formation/dissolution at the cathode. The studies by XRD confirmed the existence of Li2O2 particles as the only detected product on the discharged cathode which is deposited and grown up at the surface as well as inside the microporous layer. The cell with GDL cathode maintains a very good cyclability under potential/time controlled mode with minimum amount of electrolyte decomposed products.},

  Abstract                 = {During the cycling of Li-O2 batteries the discharge process gives rise to dynamically evolving agglomerates composed of lithium-oxygen nanostructures; however, little is known about their composition. In this paper, we present results for a Li-O2 battery based on an activated carbon cathode that indicate interfacial effects can suppress disproportionation of a LiO2 component in the discharge product. High-intensity X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements are first used to show that there is a LiO2 component along with Li2O2 in the discharge product. The stability of the discharge product was then probed by investigating the dependence of the charge potential and Raman intensity of the superoxide peak with time. The results indicate that the LiO2 component can be stable for possibly up to days when an electrolyte is left on the surface of the discharged cathode. Density functional calculations on amorphous LiO2 reveal that the disproportionation process will be slower at an electrolyte/LiO2 interface compared to a vacuum/LiO2 interface. The combined experimental and theoretical results provide new insight into how interfacial effects can stabilize LiO2 and suggest that these interfacial effects may play an important role in the charge and discharge chemistries of a Li-O2 battery.},

  abstract  = {Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) gas diffusion layers (GDLs) play important parts in diffusing gas, discharging liquid water, and conducting electricity, etc. When liquid water is discharged through GDL to gas channel, there will be some pores of GDLs occupied by liquid water. In this study, based on a one-dimensional model, the distribution of liquid water phase saturation is analyzed for different GDL structures including GDL with uniform porosity, GDL with sudden change porosity (GDL with microporous layer (MPL)) and GDL with gradient porosity distribution. The effect on gas diffusion of the changes of porosity and liquid saturation due to water remaining in GDL pores is calculated. The conclusions are that for uniform porosity GDL, the gas diffusion increases with the increase of porosity and contact angle and increases with the decrease of the thickness of GDL; for GDL with MPL, the larger the MPL porosity and the thinner the MPL thickness are, the stronger the gas diffusion is; for gradient change porosity GDL with the same average equivalent porosity, the larger the porosity gradient is, the more easily the gas diffuses. The optimization for GDL gradient structure shows that the GDL with a linear porosity distribution of 0.4x+0.4 is the best of the computed cases.},

  abstract  = {The diffusion coefficient (D(O(2))), solubility (C(O(2))), and electrochemical behavior of oxygen reduction were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and transient amperometry on a Pt ultramicroelectrode in aqueous solutions containing various concentrations of NaOH (1-12 M). The results show that both D(O(2)) and C(O(2)) decrease as the solution viscosity (eta) increases significantly with increasing concentration of NaOH. The Stokes-Einstein relationship (D(O(2)) vs 1/eta) is followed, yielding a radius for the O(2) molecule, 2.8 A, that does not change over the concentration range of NaOH studied. From results reported previously for C(O(2)) in more dilute NaOH solutions and the new results here, the number of electrons, n, involved in the first step of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was found to change with the concentration of NaOH, from n = 2 at low NaOH concentrations (1-2 M) to n = 1 at high concentrations (>6 M), in line with the changing water activity. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was employed as a sensitive tool to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the product of the ORR in 10 M NaOH solution, O(2)(*-), as a function of potential. The SECM approach curves depend on the substrate bias and state of the Pt substrate surface, and the apparent rate constant for the redox couple of O(2)/O(2)(*-) is determined to be about 2.6 x 10(-4) cm/s in this solution.},

The biocompatible film showed an improved immobilization capacity for living cells and a good biocompatibility for preserving the activity of the immobilized living cells. The immobilized K562 cells on the biocompatible film-modified electrode can be directly monitored with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- as redox probes. A highly sensitive electrochemical impedance method for the detection of leukemia K562 cancer cells was developed. Under the optimized conditions, the increased electron-transfer resistance with a good correlation to the logarithmic value of concentration of K562 cells ranging from 102 to 107cellsmL-1, and with the detection limit of 30cellsmL-1 (S/N=3). Additionally, the proposed method was used to describe the viability of cells and to evaluate the effectiveness of antitumor drug Nilotinib on K562 cells. The obtained results of Nilotinib cytotoxicity are well agreed with those from WST-1 assays. Furthermore, the work demonstrates that a highly biocompatible film of PLL/GO assembled is also expected to be an appropriate matrix for the electrochemical investigation of adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis of other relevant mammalian cells which is not limited to adherent cells, and the study of cell-based biosensors. {\copyright} 2012.},

  Abstract                 = {To explain why dynamical properties of an aqueous electrolyte near a charged surface seem to be governed by a surface charge less than the actual one, the canonical Stern model supposes an interfacial layer of ions and immobile fluid. However, large ion mobilities within the Stern layer are needed to reconcile the Stern model with surface conduction measurements. Modeling the aqueous electrolyte-amorphous silica interface at typical charge densities, a prototypical double layer system, the flow velocity does not vanish until right at the surface. The Stern model is a good effective model away from the surface, but cannot be taken literally near the surface. Indeed, simulations show no ion mobility where water is immobile, nor is such mobility necessary since the surface conductivity in the simulations is comparable to experimental values.},

Here we replace easily decomposable liquid electrolytes with a solid Li-ion conductor, which acts as both a catholyte and a Li protector. Meanwhile, the conventional solid air cathodes are replaced with a gel cathode, which contacts directly with the solid catholyte to form a closed and sustainable gel/solid interface. The proposed Li-air cell has sustained repeated cycling in ambient air for 100 cycles (\~{}78 days), with discharge capacity of 2,000 mAh g(-1). The recharging is based largely on the reversible reactions of Li{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}CO{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$f$ product, originating from the initial discharge product of Li{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}O{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase} instead of electrolyte degradation. Our results demonstrate that a reversible long-life Li-air battery is attainable by coordinated approaches towards the focal issues of electrolytes and Li metal.},

  abstract  = {The potential cycling of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) incorporating a reference electrode was carried out for 20 h. After the potential cycling, the maximum power density decreased from 56.12 mW cm-2 of the fresh membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to 47.64 mW cm-2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to conduct an independent quantitative analysis of the anode and cathode degradation. The EIS results of the anode and cathode revealed the degradation properties after the potential cycling. For the anode, the charge transfer and mass transfer resistances significantly increased after the degradation procedure, indicating that a significant degradation occurred. However, for the cathode, it was demonstrated that a slight degradation occurred, because the charge transfer and mass transfer resistances slightly increased after the degradation procedure. The increase in the charge transfer resistance was attributed to the decrease in the Pt surface area, and the increased mass transfer resistance was considered to be due to the ionomer degradation. Meanwhile, the increase in the membrane resistance and decrease in the adsorption resistance were also observed after the degradation procedure. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

At initial state, the Nyquist plots consist of one compressed semicircle in high and intermediate frequency ranges that reflect charge transfer resistance and a straight line inclined at a constant angle to the real axis in lower frequency range that reflects the diffusion properties of lithium ion in solid materials. When the cell was charged for several hours, the Nyquist plots consist of two compressed semicircles alike in appearance of a half ellipse at high and intermediate frequency ranges and an anomalous line at lower frequency range, and the shape of the second semicircle is a half ellipse in appearance almost. The information of electrolyte resistance, surface film resistance and charge transfer resistance have been obtained by modeling with two different equivalent circuits according with the Nyquist plots with different shape. It can be speculated that both the passivating film on the surface of LiCoO2 cathode and the channels for lithium ion transfer in LiCoO2 cathode are mostly formed during the first charge/discharge process. Both diffusion coefficient of lithium ion in LiCoO2 cathode and exchange current density are in accord with the analysis of the Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectra, indicating the rationality of the speculation.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe physical-organic studies of singlet oxygen generation and transport into an aqueous solution supported on superhydrophobic surfaces on which silicon-phthalocyanine (Pc) particles are immobilized. Singlet oxygen ((1)O2) was trapped by a water-soluble anthracene compound and monitored in-situ using a UV-VIS spectrometer. By flowing oxygen through the porous superhydrophobic surface, singlet oxygen generated in the plastron (i.e. the gas layer beneath the liquid) is transported into the solution within gas bubbles, thereby increasing the liquid-gas surface area over which singlet oxygen can be trapped. Significantly higher photooxidation rates were achieved in flowing oxygen, as compared to when the gas in the plastron was static. Superhydrophobic surfaces were also synthesized so that the Pc particles were located in contact with, or isolated from, the aqueous solution to evaluate the relative effectiveness of singlet oxygen generated in solution and the gas phase respectively; singlet oxygen generated on particles wetted by the solution was trapped more efficiently than singlet oxygen generated in the plastron, even in the presence of flowing oxygen gas. A mechanism is proposed that explains how Pc particle wetting, plastron gas composition and flow rate as well as gas saturation of the aqueous solution affect singlet oxygen trapping efficiency. These stable superhydrophobic surfaces which can physically isolate the photosensitizer particles from the solution may be of practical importance for delivering singlet oxygen for water purification and medical devices.},

To provide continuous oxygen channels, here, we synthesized hierarchical mesoporous perovskite La(0.5)Sr(0.5)CoO(2.91) (LSCO) nanowires. We tested the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in both aqueous electrolytes and nonaqueous electrolytes via rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements and demonstrated that the hierarchical mesoporous LSCO nanowires are high-performance catalysts for the ORR with low peak-up potential and high limiting diffusion current. Furthermore, we fabricated Li-air batteries on the basis of hierarchical mesoporous LSCO nanowires and nonaqueous electrolytes, which exhibited ultrahigh capacity, ca. over 11,000 mAh$\cdot$g(-1), one order of magnitude higher than that of LSCO nanoparticles. Besides, the possible reaction mechanism is proposed to explain the catalytic activity of the LSCO mesoporous nanowire.},

  abstract  = {Composites are formed by sorption of Nafion, an ion exchange polymer, onto inert substrates of two different microstructures: microcylinders (neutron track etched membranes) and microspheres. Flux of a neutral redox probe (hydroquinone) through the composites is measured voltammetrically. Data for the microsphere composites are presented for variation in volume fraction and bead radii. Flux is shown to increase as the ratio of surface area of the substrate to volume of Nafion increases. The enhancement is ascribed to a facile surface diffusion domain at the interface between the Nafion and the inert substrates. Enhancements are larger in the microcylinder composites. Images of the microsphere composites appear fractal. For the microsphere composites, the power law relating flux to a characteristic dimension (microsphere radius) has an exponent of 0.78. A similar analysis for the cylinders has an exponent of 1. The analysis also shows that the fundamental transport rates of surface and bulk diffusion are little different in the two composites. Thus, the difference in the flux characteristics of the two classes of composites is ascribed to the microstructure of the interface as opposed to a change in the basic flux properties. (A linear fit of the microsphere composite data is statistically comparable that of the fractal fit; however, the conductivity exponent of one for the linear fit does not capture the dimensionality of the microsphere/Nafion interface.) The smallest microspheres of radius 0.055 $\mu$m form agglomerates of radius 1.25 to 1.5 $\mu$m, while their flux characteristics are consistent with an effective radius of 0.24 $\mu$m.},

The investigation was focused on the PYR1ATFSI ionic liquid family because of the interesting electrochemical properties of the members with propyl and butyl side chains. Side alkyl groups (A = CnH2n+1 with n ranging from 1 to 10) of different length and structure were used for the synthesis of PYR1ATFSI materials. NMR and DSC have shown that the ionic liquids were correctly synthesized with the exception of the compounds with tertiary side chains. Most of the materials exhibited a conductivity higher than 10-3 S cm-1 already at 12 ??C. In the molten state a moderate conductivity decrease was observed with increasing the length and the branching of the side chain (C2H2n+1) group according with the change of viscosity of the ionic liquids. Most of the PYR1ATFSI samples exhibited an electrochemical stability window exceeding 5 V. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Aqueous Li-air batteries have attracted a great deal of attention due to their high theoretical energy capacities. However, while still in the early stages of research, the reported energy capacities of Li-air batteries are far from what has been theoretically predicted. In this research, we have designed a Li-air battery that has a Li organic liquid electrolyte Li +- conducting glass ceramic plate (LiGC plate) aqueous electrolyte Pt air electrode structure and studied the impacts of the compositions of the aqueous electrolyte on the battery performance. With lower concentrations of alkali aqueous electrolytes (???0.05 M LiOH), a discharge voltage of approximately 3.5 V (at 0.05 mA cm -2) and a voltage efficiency up to 84\% were observed. The addition of LiClO 4 into the aqueous solution slightly lowered the discharge voltage to 3.3 V but dramatically decreased the internal resistance of the battery to 35.4 ?? cm -2. With a charge voltage plateau observed at 3.90 V at a current of 0.05 mA cm -2, the Li organic liquid electrolyte LiGC 1 M LiClO 4 Pt air battery showed an 85\% voltage efficiency at room temperature. Adding LiClO 4 into the aqueous electrolytes resulted in an impedance reduction and slowed the pH increase of the alkaline-based electrolyte due to the fast or long-term discharge of the air electrode in the Li-air battery. The discharge and charge voltage behaviors of the battery and the changes to the pH values of the aqueous electrolyte at different current rates were also recorded and are presented in this paper. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {An in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to the investigation of LiCoO2 electrode in ethylene and ethyl methyl carbonates electrolyte. The electrode impedance was plotted on the three-dimensional diagram, which has real, imaginary and time axes, with the measurements of the charge (deintercalation) and discharge (intercalation) curves. The formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on LiCoO 2 electrode was discussed by the variation of impedance spectra. It was found that the SEI structure was constructed on LiCoO2 electrode and its resistance changed by the reversible process. Moreover, the effects of vinylene carbonate and ethylene sulfite as additives into the electrolyte were investigated. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work is to study the physical self-healing properties of shape memory polyurethanes (SMPUs) with cerium ions on top of a pure aluminum substrate. To achieve this, the 'odd random phase multisine' electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used. The additional information given by this technique (stochastic noise, non-linear and non-stationary behavior of the sample during the measurement) has been useful to verify the quality of the measurement. Moreover, combined with a fitting algorithm weighted by the stochastic noise, these elements of information proved powerful in rejecting, accepting or improving electrical equivalent circuit models used to fit the impedance spectra. These SMPU consist of two parts: a soft matrix in caprolactone and a hard part in polyurethane. SMPU with 12, 30 and 41\% of hard phase were investigated. The results showed that a physical self-healing can be observed for the coating with 12\% of hard phase. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Two-phase transport of reactants and products constitutes an important limit in performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC). Particularly, at high current densities and/or low gas flow rates, product water condenses in open pores of the cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) and limits the effective oxygen transport to the active catalyst sites. Furthermore, liquid water covers some of the active catalytic surface, rendering them inactive for electrochemical reaction. Traditionally, these two-phase transport processes in the GDL are modeled using so-called unsaturated flow theory (UFT), in which a uniform gas-phase pressure is assumed across the entire porous layer, thereby ignoring the gas-phase flow counter to capillarity-induced liquid motion. In this work, using multi-phase mixture (M2) formalism, the constant gas pressure assumption is relaxed and the effects of counter gas-flow are studied and found to be a new oxygen transport mechanism. Further, we analyze the multi-layer diffusion media, composed of two or more layers of porous materials having different pore sizes and/or wetting characteristics. Particularly, the effects of porosity, thickness and wettability of a micro-porous layer (MPL) on the two-phase transport in PEFC are elucidated.},

  Abstract                 = {The thermodynamic stability and electronic structure of 40 surfaces of lithium peroxide (Li(2)O(2)) and lithium oxide (Li(2)O) were characterized using first-principles calculations. As these compounds constitute potential discharge products in Li-oxygen batteries, their surface properties are expected to play a key role in understanding electrochemical behavior in these systems. Stable surfaces were identified by comparing 23 distinct Li(2)O(2) surfaces and 17 unique Li(2)O surfaces; crystallite areal fractions were determined through application of the Wulff construction. Accounting for the oxygen overbinding error in density functional theory results in the identification of several new Li(2)O(2) oxygen-rich \{0001\} and \{1 {\`{I}}{\ldots}100\} terminations that are more stable than those previously reported. Although oxygen-rich facets predominate in Li(2)O(2), in Li(2)O stoichiometric surfaces are preferred, consistent with prior studies. Surprisingly, surface-state analyses reveal that the stable surfaces of Li(2)O(2) are half-metallic, despite the fact that Li(2)O(2) is a bulk insulator. Surface oxygens in these facets are ferromagnetic with magnetic moments ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 $\mu$(B). In contrast, the stable surfaces of Li(2)O are insulating and nonmagnetic. The distinct surface properties of these compounds may explain observations of electrochemical reversibility for systems in which Li(2)O(2) is the discharge product and the irreversibility of systems that discharge to Li(2)O. Moreover, the presence of conductive surface pathways in Li(2)O(2) could offset capacity limitations expected to arise from limited electron transport through the bulk.},

  Abstract                 = {Li-O(2) battery is regarded as one of the most promising energy storage systems for future applications. However, its energy efficiency is greatly undermined by the large overpotentials of the discharge (formation of Li(2)O(2)) and charge (oxidation of Li(2)O(2)) reactions. The parasitic reactions of electrolyte and carbon electrode induced by the high charging potential cause the decay of capacity and limit the battery life. Here, a K-O(2) battery is report that uses K(+) ions to capture O(2)(-) to form the thermodynamically stable KO(2) product. This allows for the battery to operate through the one-electron redox process of O(2)/O(2)(-). Our studies confirm the formation and removal of KO(2) in the battery cycle test. Furthermore, without the use of catalysts, the battery shows a low discharge/charge potential gap of less than 50 mV at a modest current density, which is the lowest one that has ever been reported in metal-oxygen batteries.},

  Abstract                 = {Metal-free graphene nanosheets (GNSs) were examined for use as air electrodes in a Li-air battery with a hybrid electrolyte. At 0.5 mA cm(-1), the GNSs showed a high discharge voltage that was near that of the 20 wt \% Pt/carbon black. This was ascribed to the presence of sp(3) bonding associated with edge and defect sites in GNSs. Moreover, heat-treated GNSs not only provided a similar catalytic activity in reducing oxygen in the air, but also showed a much more-stable cycling performance than GNSs when used in a rechargeable Li-air battery. This improvement resulted from removal of adsorbed functional groups and from crystallization of the GNS surface into a graphitic structure on heat treatment.},

  abstract  = {Oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORRs and OERs) have been studied in ionic liquids containing singly charged cations having a range of ionic radii, or charge densities. Specifically, ORR and OER mechanisms were studied using cyclic and rotating disk electrode voltammetry in the neat ionic liquids (ILs), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI) and 1-methyl-1-butyl-pyrrolidinium bis(triflouromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYR14TFSI), and in their solutions containing LiTFSI, NaPF6, KPF6, and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6). A strong correlation was found between the ORR products and the ionic charge density, including those of the ionic liquids. The observed trend is explained in terms of the Lewis acidity of the cation present in the electrolyte using an acidity scale created from 13C NMR chemical shifts and spin?lattice relaxation (T1) times of 13C*O in solutions of these charged ions in propylene carbonate (PC). The ionic liquids lie in a continuum of a cascading Lewis acidity scale with respect to the charge density of alkali metal, IL, and TBA cations with the result that the ORR products in ionic liquids and in organic electrolytes containing any conducting cations can be predicted on the basis of a general theory based on the hard soft acid base (HSAB) concept.},

  abstract = {The influence of lithium salts on O2 reduction reactions (ORR) in 1, 2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) has been investigated. Microelectrode studies in a series of tetrabutylammonium salt (TBA salt)/DME-based electrolytes showed that O2 solubility and diffusion coefficient are not significantly affected by the electrolyte anion. The ORR voltammograms on microelectrodes in these electrolytes exhibited steady-state limiting current behavior. In contrast, peak-shaped voltammograms were observed in Li+-conducting electrolytes suggesting a reduction of the effective electrode area by passivating ORR products as well as migration-diffusion control of the reactants at the microelectrode. FT-IR spectra have revealed that Li+ ions are solvated to form solvent separated ion pairs of the type Li+(DME)nPF6- and Li+(TEGDME)PF6- in LiPF6-based electrolytes. On the other hand, the contact ion pairs (DME)mLi+(CF3SO3-) and(TEGDME)Li+(CF3SO3-) appear to form in LiSO3CF3-containing electrolytes. In the LiSO3CF3based electrolytes the initial ORR product, superoxide (O2-), is stabilized in solution by forming [(DME)m-1(O2-)]Li+(CF3SO3-) and [(TEGDME)(O2-)]Li+(CF3SO3-) complexes. These soluble superoxide complexes are able to diffuse away from the electrode surface reaction sites to the bulk electrolyte in the electrode pores where they decompose to form Li2O2. This explains the higher capacity obtained in Li/O2 cells utilizing LiCF3SO3/TEGDME electrolytes.},

The model includes charge transport, diffusion, chemical reactions, viscosity, elasticity and polarization under isothermal conditions. There is a coupling between these phenomena that particularly involves the local pressure in the electrolyte. Therefore the momentum balance is of major importance for the correct description of the boundary layers. The width of the boundary layers is typically very small compared to the macroscopic dimensions of the system. In the second step we thus apply the method of asymptotic analysis to derive a simpler reduced bulk model that already incorporates the electrochemical properties of the double layers into a set of new boundary conditions. With the reduced model, we analyze the double layer capacitance for a metal-electrolyte interface.},

  abstract  = {This paper reports on the solubility and diffusivity of dissolved oxygen in a series of ionic liquids (ILs) based on the bis{(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl}imide anion with a range of related alkyl and ether functionalised cyclic alkylammonium cations. Cyclic voltammetry has been used to observe the reduction of oxygen in ILs at a microdisk electrode and chronoamperometric measurements have then been applied to simultaneously determine both the concentration and the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in different ILs. The viscosity of the ILs and the calculated molar volume and free volume are also reported. It is found that, within this class of ILs, the oxygen diffusivity generally increases with decreasing viscosity of the neat IL. An inverse relationship between oxygen solubility and IL free volume is reported for the two IL families implying that oxygen is not simply occupying the available empty space. In addition, it is reported that the introduction of an ether-group into the IL cation structure promotes the diffusivity of dissolved oxygen but reduces the solubility of the gas.},

Toray carbon cloth is selected as cathode, which serves as large-porosity electrodes with an approximately planar reaction surface. Imaging analysis shows film formation of precipitates is observed in all the experiments. In addition, toroidal and aggregate morphologies are present under lower currents as well. Specially, toroidal or partially toroidal deposit is observed for 0.06 A/cm2. Aggregates, which consist of small particles with grain boundaries, are shown for 0.03 A/cm2. We found that the film-resistor model is unable to predict the discharge voltage behaviors under the two lower currents due to the presence of the deposit morphologies other than the film formation. The coverage model's prediction shows acceptable agreement with the experimental data because the model accounts for impacts of various morphologies of precipitates.},

We found that the effective built-in electric field profile inside the cell is influenced by the density and distribution of the electronic traps located below the conduction band edge of the TiO2. Although the value of electric field remains low compared to conventional p-n junction solar cells, our results support that the high concentration of ionic species composing the electrolyte prompts a drift current of ionic species, comparable to the related ionic diffusion current, when the device is exposed to light illumination under short-circuit conditions. The simulations carried out for different electrolyte compositions tend to demonstrate that ionic drift is a process which can never been suppressed and therefore should be considered in the description of the mass transport. These results participate in the better understanding of the working principle of the complex and multifaceted chemistry of dye-sensitized solar cells.},

The approach couples an atomistically-resolved Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) modeling module describing the electrochemical kinetics in an active material, with continuum modeling modules describing reactants transport at the active material/electrolyte nanoscopic interface (electrochemical double layer region) and along the mesoscale electrode thickness. The KMC module is developed by extending the so-called Variable Step Size Method (VSSM) algorithm (called here Electrochemical-VSSM) and constitutes the first VSSM extension reported so far which allows calculating the electrode potential as function of the imposed current density. The KMC module can be parameterized with activation energies calculated from Density Functional Theory (DFT), and thanks to the coupling with the transport modules, it describes the materials reactivity in electrochemical conditions. This approach allows us to study how the surface morphology (e.g. distribution of inactive sites, size of the active material particle, etc.) impacts the performance of the electrode. As an application example, we report here a computational investigation of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) kinetics in a Pt(111)-based Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) cathode.},

CGMD is used to generate structural databases that relate the amount of detached (degraded) ionomer sidechains with the water content and the resulting PEM meso-microporous structure. The multiscale cell performance model describes the electrochemical reactions and transport mechanisms occuring in the electrodes from an on-the-fly coupling between Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) sub-models parametrized with Density Functional Theory (DFT) data and (partial differential equations-based) continuum sub-models. Furthermore, the performance model includes a kinetic PEM degradation sub-model which integrates the CGMD database. The cell model also predicts the instantaneous PEM sidechain content and conductivity evolution at each time step. The coupling of these diverse modeling paradigms allows one to describe the feedback between the instantaneous cell performance and the intrinsic membrane degradation processes. This provides detailed insights on the membrane degradation (sidechain detachment as well as water reorganization within the PEM) during cell operation. This novel modeling approach opens interesting perspectives in engineering practice to predict materials degradation and durability as a function of the initial chemical composition and structural properties in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.},

Firstly, CO adsorption effect on PtxCoy has been studied by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Then, the MC results were coupled with a non-equilibrium thermodynamics kinetics model (MEMEPhys®) to simulate the effect of CO poisoning on the activity and durability of PtxCoy nanoparticles as HOR catalysts. The results are compared with simulations carried out on Pt, where potential self-oscillatory behaviour is observed and experimentally confirmed. The PtxCoy HOR activity and stability properties reveal to be strongly dependent on the nanoparticle size and composition. For certain nanoparticle sizes, simulations show that PtCo nanoparticles provide better CO tolerance than Pt3Co. However, the CO tolerance of PtCo degrades faster than that of Pt3Co in long-term operation. From both modeling and experimental approaches, it is demonstrated for the first time that this observation is due to the fact that CO adsorption enhances Cobalt dissolution.},

In the model, active surface area degrades during discharge because of three reasons. First, the effective radius of pores decreases due to Li2O2 coverage. Secondly, small pores may be fully choked. Thirdly, thick Li2O2 film may block the electron tunneling process, rendering the surface inactive. Simulation results reveal that the end of discharge in cells made of Super P and Ketjen Black carbons is caused by unavailable surface area near the air inlet, rather than the full choking of pores. Larger discharge capacity is found in the Ketjen Black cell because its high specific surface area leads to slower Li2O2 thickness growth rate. We compare this tunneling-limited model with a linear resistance model where the Li2O2 thin film resistance is assumed to be proportional to its thickness. Different shapes of discharge curves have been discovered: the former has a long discharge plateau followed by a sudden drop of cell voltage, while the latter shows a gradual decrease of cell voltage. These results are discussed in relation to the experimental knowledge.},

It is supported on an extension to three dimensions of our Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) Electrochemical Variable Step Size Method (E-VSSM) recently published by our group in [M. A. Quiroga and A. A. Franco, J. Electrochem. Soc., 162, E73 (2015)]. The model allows predicting porosity evolution as a function of multiple operational, physical and geometrical parameters including the pore size and inlet/outlet channel size, O2 and Li+ concentration, the property of the solvent as well as the applied overpotential. The investigation of the impact of these different aspects reveals that at the mesoscale level, the overall ORR kinetics and the discharge mechanism strongly depend on a balance between the geometrical features of the pore and the transport as well as the electrochemical properties of the system.},

New material or new battery system development is an alternative approach to achieve the goal of new high-energy storage system with energy densities 5 times or more greater. A series of SeSx-carbon (x = 0-7) composite materials has been prepared and evaluated as the positive electrodes in secondary lithium cells with ether-based electrolyte. In situ synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction was utilized to investigate the crystalline phase transition during cell cycling. Complementary, in situ Se K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis was used to track the evolution of the Se valence state for both crystalline and noncrystalline phases, including amorphous and electrolyte-dissolved phases in the (de)lithiation process. On the basis of these results, a mechanism for the (de)lithiation process is proposed, where Se is reduced to the polyselenides, Li2Sen (n {\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textyen} 4), Li2Se2, and Li2Se sequentially during the lithiation and Li2Se is oxidized to Se through Li2Sen (n {\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textyen} 4) during the delithiation. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated the reversibility of the Li/Se system in ether-based electrolyte and the presence of side products in the carbonate-based electrolytes. For Li/SeS2 and Li/SeS7 cells, Li2Se and Li2S are the discharged products with the presence of Se only as the crystalline phase in the end of charge.},

  abstract  = {Polymer-particle composites are used in virtually every field of technology. When the particles approach nanometer dimensions, large interfacial regions are created. In favorable situations, the spatial distribution of these interfaces can be controlled to create new hybrid materials with physical and transport properties inaccessible in their constituents or poorly prepared mixtures. This review surveys progress in the last decade in understanding phase behavior, structure, and properties of nanoparticle-polymer composites. The review takes a decidedly polymers perspective and explores how physical and chemical approaches may be employed to create hybrids with controlled distribution of particles. Applications are studied in two contexts of contemporary interest: battery electrolytes and electrodes. In the former, the role of dispersed and aggregated particles on ion-transport is considered. In the latter, the polymer is employed in such small quantities that it has been historically given titles such as binder and carbon precursor that underscore its perceived secondary role. Considering the myriad functions the binder plays in an electrode, it is surprising that highly filled composites have not received more attention. Opportunities in this and related areas are highlighted where recent advances in synthesis and polymer science are inspiring new approaches, and where newcomers to the field could make important contributions.},

  abstract  = {Li/O2 batteries draw much of attention due to its outstanding theoretical specific energy, but the value of practically achievable specific energy is still under the question. In this paper we employ numerical model of Li/O2 cell, which takes into account mass transport processes, to simulate non-uniform product precipitation at different discharge current densities in acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide and 1,2-dimethoxyethane-based electrolytes. Even for 1,2-dimethoxyethane, which has the highest oxygen mobility and solubility, oxygen transport restrictions at 1 mA/cm2 lead to cell-level specific energy of about 650 Wh/kg if a pure oxygen is supplied to the cell. Finally, in order to assist the ongoing search for new cathode materials, which can be alternative to carbon, we also investigate the effect of electrode material density on cell-level specific energy and show that materials with densities up to 10 g/cm3 can be used without serious penalty to the specific energy.},

  abstract = {One of the practical bottlenecks associated with commercialization of lithium-air cells is the choice of an appropriate electrolyte that provides the required combination of cell performance, cyclability and safety. With the help of a two-dimensional multiphysics model, we attempt to narrow down the electrolyte choice by providing insights into the effect of the transport properties of electrolyte, electrode saturation (flooded versus gas diffusion), and electrode thickness on a single discharge performance of a lithium-air button cell cathode for five different electrolytes including water, ionic liquid, carbonate, ether, and sulfoxide. The 2D distribution of local current density and concentrations of electrochemically active species (O2 and Li+) in the cathode is also discussed w.r.t electrode saturation. Furthermore, the efficacy of species transport in the cathode is quantified by introducing two parameters, firstly, a transport efficiency that gives local insight into the distribution of mass transfer losses, and secondly, an active electrode volume that gives global insight into the cathode volume utilization at different current densities. A detailed discussion is presented toward understanding the design-induced performance limitations in a Li-air button cell prototype.},

Different from lithium-oxygen cells, where lithium peroxide is found as the discharge product, sodium superoxide (NaO2) is formed in the present cell, with overpotentials as low as 100 mV during charging. Several analytical methods are used to follow the cell reaction during discharge and charge. Changes in structure and morphology are studied by SEM and XRD. It is found that NaO2 grows as cubic particles with feed sizes in the range of 10-50 {$\mu$}m; upon recharge the particles consecutively decompose. Pressure monitoring during galvanostatic cycling shows that the coulombic efficiency (e(-)/O2) for discharge and charge is approx. 1.0, the expected value for NaO2 formation. Also optical spectroscopy is identified as a convenient and useful tool to follow the discharge-charge process. The maximum discharge capacity is found to be limited by oxygen transport within the electrolyte soaked carbon fiber cathode and pore blocking near the oxygen interface is observed. Finally electrolyte decomposition and sodium dendrite growth are identified as possible reasons for the limited capacity retention of the cell. The occurrence of undesired side reactions is analyzed by DEMS measurements during cycling as well as by post mortem XPS investigations.},

The local current density{,} which is an important parameter in determining the performance of lithium-air batteries{,} is a function of the rate constant of the electron transfer reactions at the surface of the cathode. In this study{,} a novel method based on Marcus theory is presented to investigate the effect of varying the length of the alkyl side chain of model imidazolium based cations and the operating temperature on the rates of electron transfer reactions at the cathode. The necessary free energies of all the species involved in the multi-step reduction of oxygen into the peroxide ion were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). Our results indicate that the magnitude of the Gibbs free energy for the reduction of oxygen into the superoxide ion and also for the reduction of superoxide into the peroxide ion increases with an increase in the static dielectric constant of the ionic liquid. This trend in turn corresponds to the decrease in the length of the alkyl side chain of the ionic liquid cation. Furthermore{,} the change in Gibbs free energy decreases with increase in the operating temperature. The inner-sphere reorganization energies were evaluated using Nelsen{'}s four point method. The total reorganization energies of all reduction reactions increase with decrease in the length of the alkyl side chain and increase in the operating temperature. Finally{,} the rate constants of the electron transfer reaction involved in the reduction of oxygen were calculated. The logarithm of the reaction rate constants decreases with increase in the static dielectric constant and increases with increase in the operating temperature. Our results provide fundamental insight into the kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transfer reactions at the cathode that will help in the identification of appropriate electrolytes for enhanced performance of lithium-air batteries.},

[Aoki, K.; et al. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1981, 122, 19]. A theory and simulation designed for cyclic voltammetry at microdisk electrodes was then employed to determine the diffusion coefficient of the electrogenerated superoxide species, O2$\bullet$-, as well as compute theoretical voltammograms to confirm the values of D and c for neutral oxygen obtained from the transients. As expected, the diffusion coefficient of the superoxide species was found to be smaller than that of the oxygen in both ionic liquids. The diffusion coefficients of O2 and O2$\bullet$- in [N6222][N(Tf)2], however, differ by more than a factor of 30 (DO2 10-10 m2 s-1, DO2 pronounced asymmetry in the concentration distributions of oxygen and superoxide, resulting in significant differences in the heights of the forward and back peaks in the cyclic voltammograms for the reduction of oxygen. This observation is most likely a result of the higher viscosity of [N6222][N(Tf)2] in comparison to [EMIM][N(Tf)2], due to the structural differences in cationic component.},

  abstract  = {Non-aqueous electrolytes play a prominent role in the redox reactions of the oxygen electrode in the non-aqueous Li-air battery. In all electrolytes the initial O2 reduction reaction (ORR) product is superoxide, O2$-$, whose stability is determined by the Lewis acidity of the ion-pairing cations present in the medium as governed by the Hard Soft Acid Base (HSAB) theory. Our results suggest that depending on the basicity of the solvent as measured by its Donor Number (DN), the superoxide will be stabilized to varying lengths of time before transforming to O22$-$ via a chemical or an electrochemical reaction. Organic solvents decrease the Lewis acidity of Li+ through the formation of solvates, Li+(solvent)n. As a result, high DN solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which decrease Li+ acidity more than low DN solvents, provide longer life-time for the soft base O2$-$ by forming the ion pair, Li+(DMSO)n--O2$-$. In low DN solvents such as 1, 2-dimethoxy ethane (DME) and tetraethyleneglycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), the LiO2 rapidly decomposes to the peroxide, Li2O2. As the ionic bond strength between the O2 reduction product and the conducting salt cation becomes stronger, its rechargeability becomes poorer. Solvent electron donor property affects ORR catalysis also.},

The latter provide a lower overpotential on charge due to their nature and close contact with the conductive electrode surface, albeit at the expense of lower discharge capacity.},

  abstract = {The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model is based on a mean-field approximation of ion interactions and continuum descriptions of concentration and electrostatic potential. It provides qualitative explanation and increasingly quantitative predictions of experimental measurements for the ion transport problems in many areas such as semiconductor devices, nanofluidic systems, and biological systems, despite many limitations. While the PNP model gives a good prediction of the ion transport phenomenon for chemical, physical, and biological systems, the number of equations to be solved and the number of diffusion coefficient profiles to be determined for the calculation directly depend on the number of ion species in the system, since each ion species corresponds to one Nernst-Planck equation and one position-dependent diffusion coefficient profile. In a complex system with multiple ion species, the PNP can be computationally expensive and parameter demanding, as experimental measurements of diffusion coefficient profiles are generally quite limited for most confined regions such as ion channels, nanostructures and nanopores. We propose an alternative model to reduce number of Nernst-Planck equations to be solved in complex chemical and biological systems with multiple ion species by substituting Nernst-Planck equations with Boltzmann distributions of ion concentrations. As such, we solve the coupled Poisson-Boltzmann and Nernst-Planck (PBNP) equations, instead of the PNP equations. The proposed PBNP equations are derived from a total energy functional by using the variational principle. We design a number of computational techniques, including the Dirichlet to Neumann mapping, the matched interface and boundary, and relaxation based iterative procedure, to ensure efficient solution of the proposed PBNP equations. Two protein molecules, cytochrome c551 and Gramicidin A, are employed to validate the proposed model under a wide range of bulk ion concentrations and external voltages. Extensive numerical experiments show that there is an excellent consistency between the results predicted from the present PBNP model and those obtained from the PNP model in terms of the electrostatic potentials, ion concentration profiles, and current-voltage (I-V) curves. The present PBNP model is further validated by a comparison with experimental measurements of I-V curves under various ion bulk concentrations. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed PBNP model is more efficient than the original PNP model in terms of simulation time.},

Most current methods for contact resistance estimation are experimental and there is a lack of well developed theoretical methods. A micro-scale numerical model is developed to predict the electrical contact resistance between BPP and GDL by simulating the BPP surface topology and GDL structure and numerically determining the status for each contact spot. The total resistance and pressure are obtained by considering all contact spots as resistances in parallel and summing the results together. This model shows good agreements with experimental results. Influences of BPP surface roughness parameters on contact resistance are also studied. This model is beneficial in understanding the contact behavior between BPP and GDL and can be integrated with other fuel cell simulations to predict the overall performance of PEM fuel cells.},

The discharge capacity can be increased if Li2O2 forms as large toroidal particles rather than as a thin conformal layer. Here, we show that trace amounts of electrolyte additives, such as H2O, enhance the formation of Li2O2 toroids and result in significant improvements in capacity. Our experimental observations and a growth model show that the solvating properties of the additives prompt a solution-based mechanism that is responsible for the growth of Li2O2 toroids. We present a general formalism describing an additive{'}s tendency to trigger the solution process, providing a rational design route for electrolytes that afford larger lithium{--}oxygen battery capacities.},

In this work, we use ab initio calculations to demonstrate that a facile mechanism for recharging Li2O2 exists. Rather than the direct decomposition pathway of Li2O2 into Li and O2 suggested by equilibrium thermodynamics, we find an alternative reaction pathway based on topotactic delithiation of Li2O2 to form off-stoichiometric Li2--xO2 compounds akin to the charging mechanism in typical Li-ion intercalation electrodes. The low formation energy of bulk Li2--xO2 phases confirms that this topotactic delithiation mechanism is rendered accessible at relatively small overpotentials of $\sim$0.3--0.4 V and is likely to be kinetically favored over Li2O2 decomposition. Our findings indicate that at the Li2O2 particle level there are no obstacles to increase the current density, and point to an exciting opportunity to create fast charging Li--air...},

  abstract  = {The preferential solvation of solutes in mixed solvent systems is an interesting phenomenon that plays important roles in solubility and kinetics. In the present study, solvation of a lithium atom in aqueous ammonia solution has been investigated from first principles molecular dynamics simulations. Solvation of alkali metal atoms, like lithium, in aqueous and ammonia media is particularly interesting because the alkali metal atoms release their valence electrons in these media so as to produce solvated electrons and metal counterions. In the present work, first principles simulations are performed employing the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics method. Spontaneous ionization of the Li atom is found to occur in the mixed solvent system. From the radial distribution functions, it is found that the Li(+) ion is preferentially solvated by water and the coordination number is mostly four in its first solvation shell and exchange of water molecules between the first and second solvation shells is essentially negligible in the time scale of our simulations. The Li(+) ion and the unbound electron are well separated and screened by the polar solvent molecules. Also the unbound electron is primarily captured by the hydrogens of water molecules. The diffusion rates of Li(+) ion and water molecules in its first solvation shell are found to be rather slow. In the bulk phase, the diffusion of water is found to be slower than that of ammonia molecules because of strong ammonia-water hydrogen bonds that participate in solvating ammonia molecules in the mixture. The ratio of first and second rank orientational correlation functions deviate from 3, which suggests a deviation from the ideal Debye-type orientational diffusion. It is found that the hydrogen bond lifetimes of ammonia-ammonia pairs is very short. However, ammonia-water H-bonds are found to be quite strong when ammonia acts as an acceptor and these hydrogen bonds are found to live longer than even water-water hydrogen bonds.},

  abstract  = {General considerations in nonlinear least squares fitting of small-signal ac frequency response data (conductive or dielectric systems) are first discussed. A very general and flexible complex nonlinear least squares fitting (CNLS) program (LOMFP) is described which runs on microcomputers of the PC and AT type. Advantages and disadvantages of LOMFP are discussed and compared to those of a recent CNLS program developed by Boukamp. LOMFP incorporates many thousands of equivalent circuits fitting possibilities and ten different distributed circuit elements which can be used in these circuits. Its fitting is both speedy and accurate, and it provides considerable insurance against confusing local minima fits with true least squares fits. It is optimized for fitting real, imaginary, or complex data of either partly conducting or purely dielectric character, and it incorporates great flexibility in handling and fitting data in different forms (different immittance levels and rectangular or polar representation). Seven different data weighting choices are provided. Exact synthetic data were generated from a typical Impedance Spectroscopy equivalent circuit, and the effects on CNLS fitting were investigated of rounding the exact data to 4, 3, and 2 decimal places. We present the results of an extensive study of the effects of transforming exact data to different immittance levels and representations and then rounding to two places or of transforming rounded 2-place data directly. We conclude that real data should not be transformed from its original measured form before carrying out CNLS fitting. Finally, the effects were investigated of various kinds of weightings on CNLS fitting of 2-place data, leading to the conclusion that in spite of its advocacy and use by Zoltowski and Boukamp, modulus weighting generally yields misleading and appreciably worse CNLS fitting results than does proportional weighting. The LOMFP program (source and executable files) is available from the first author.},

  abstract  = {A generalized three dimensional computational model based on unified formulation of electrode--electrolyte system of an electric double layer supercapacitor has been developed. This model accounts for charge transport across the electrode-electrolyte system. It is based on volume averaging, a widely used technique in multiphase flow modeling ([1,2]) and is analogous to porous media theory employed for electrochemical systems [3--5]. A single-domain approach is considered in the formulation where there is no need to model the interfacial boundary conditions explicitly as done in prior literature ([6]). Spatio-temporal variations, anisotropic physical properties, and upscaled parameters from lower length-scale simulations and experiments can be easily introduced in the formulation. Model complexities like irregular geometric configuration, porous electrodes, charge transport and related performance characteristics of the supercapacitor can be effectively captured in higher dimensions. This generalized model also provides insight into the applicability of 1D models ([6]) and where multidimensional effects need to be considered. A sensitivity analysis is presented to ascertain the dependence of the charge and discharge processes on key model parameters. Finally, application of the formulation to non-planar supercapacitors is presented.},

  abstract  = {The Li-S battery has been under intense scrutiny for over two decades, as it offers the possibility of high gravimetric capacities and theoretical energy densities ranging up to a factor of five beyond conventional Li-ion systems. Herein, we report the feasibility to approach such capacities by creating highly ordered interwoven composites. The conductive mesoporous carbon framework precisely constrains sulphur nanofiller growth within its channels and generates essential electrical contact to the insulating sulphur. The structure provides access to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulphur, and we speculate that the kinetic inhibition to diffusion within the framework and the sorption properties of the carbon aid in trapping the polysulphides formed during redox. Polymer modification of the carbon surface further provides a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of these large anions out of the electrode, thus facilitating more complete reaction. Reversible capacities up to 1,320 mA h g(-1) are attained. The assembly process is simple and broadly applicable, conceptually providing new opportunities for materials scientists for tailored design that can be extended to many different electrode materials.},

  abstract  = {The wetting of microstructured surfaces is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Even relatively simple surface topographies such as grooves with rectangular cross section exhibit a large variety of different wetting morphologies as observed by atomic force microscopy. This polymorphism arises from liquid wedge formation along the groove corners and from contact line pinning along the groove edges. A global morphology diagram is derived that depends only on two system parameters: (i) the aspect ratio of the groove geometry and (ii) The contact angle of the underlying substrate material. For microfluidics, the most interesting shape regimes involve extended liquid filaments, which can grow and shrink in length while their cross section stays essentially constant. Thus, any method by which one can vary the contact angle can be used to switch the length of the filament, as is demonstrated in the context of electrowetting.},

  abstract = {Li-air batteries have attracted interest as energy storage devices due to their high energy and power density. Li-air batteries are expected to revolutionize the automobile industry (for use in electric and hybrid vehicles) and electrochemical energy storage systems by surpassing the energy capacities of conventional Li-ion batteries. However, the practical implementation of Li-air batteries is still hindered by many challenges, such as low cyclic performance and high charging voltage, resulting from oxygen transport limitations, electrolyte degradation, and the formation of irreversible reduction products. Therefore, various methodologies have been attempted to mitigate the issues causing performance degradation of Li-air batteries. Among myriad studies, theoretical and numerical modeling are powerful tools for describing and investigating the chemical reactions, reactive ion transportation, and electrical performance of batteries. Herein, we review the various multi-physics/scale models used to provide mechanistic insights into processes in Li-air batteries and relate these to overall battery performance. First, continuum-based models describing ion transport, pore blocking phenomena, and reduction product precipitation are presented. Next, atomistic modeling-based studies that provide an understanding of the reaction mechanisms in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as well as ion-ion interactions in the electrolyte, are described.},

  abstract  = {Non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries are an intensively studied future energy storage technology due to their high theoretical energy density. However, a number of barriers prevent a practical application, and one of the major challenges is the reduction of the high charge overpotential: Whereas lithium peroxide (Li2O2) is formed during discharge at around 2.7 V (vs. Li+/Li), its electrochemical decomposition during the charge process requires potentials up to 4.5 V. This high potential gap leads to a low round-trip efficiency of the cell, and more important, the high charge potential causes electrochemical decomposition of other cell constituents. Dissolved oxidation catalysts can act as mobile redox mediators (RM) which enable the oxidation of Li2O2 particles even without a direct electric contact to the positive electrode. Herein we show that the addition of 10 mM TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl), homogeneously dissolved in the electrolyte, provides a distinct reduction of the charging potentials by 500 mV. Moreover, TEMPO enables a significant enhancement of the cycling stability leading to a doubling of the cycle life. The efficiency of the TEMPO mediated catalysis was further investigated by a parallel monitoring of the cell pressure which excludes a considerable contribution of a parasitic shuttle (i.e. internal ionic short circuit) to the anode during cycling. We prove the suitability of TEMPO by a systematic study of the relevant physical and chemical properties, i.e. its (electro )chemical stability, redox potential, diffusion coefficient and the influence on the oxygen solubility. Furthermore the charging mechanism of Li-O2 cells with and without TEMPO were compared by combining different electrochemical and analytical techniques.},

Despite the increasing interest in marine nitrogen fixation, no gas solubility (Bunsen) coefficients for ethylene in seawater are published to date. Here, we provide a set of equations and present semiempirically derived Bunsen coefficients for ethylene in water (ranging from 0.069 to 0.226) for a range of temperatures and salinities that are relevant for aquatic nitrogen fixation. We apply these data to nitrogen fixation scenarios at different temperatures and salin- ities and stress the importance of using accurate Bunsen coefficients in nitrogen fixation assays.},

  abstract = {The maximum discharge capacity in non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries has been limited to a fraction of its theoretical value, largely due to a conformal deposition of Li2O2 on the cathode surface. However, it has recently been established that additives that increase the shielding of either O2− or Li+ will activate the formation of toroidal shaped Li2O2, thereby dramatically increasing cell capacity. Here we apply porous electrode theory to electrochemical impedance measured at the Li-O2 cathode to investigate changes in the surface- and ionic resistance within the pores under conditions where either the surface-mechanism or the solution-mechanism is favored. Our experimental observations show that (i) an additional charge transfer process is observed in the impedance spectrum where the solution-based mechanism is favored; (ii) that the changes in the ionic resistance in the cathode during discharge (related to Li2O2 build up) is much greater in cells where the solution-based mechanism is activated and can qualitatively determine the extent of discharge product deposited within the pores of the cathode versus the deposition extent at the electrode/electrolyte interface; and (iii) that the observed “sudden-death” during discharge is a consequence of the increasing charge transfer resistance regardless of whether Li2O2 forms predominantly through either the surface- or solution-based mechanism.},

  abstract  = {Supercapacitors have exceptional power density and cyclability but smaller energy density than batteries. Their energy density can be increased using ionic liquids and electrodes with subnanometre pores, but this tends to reduce their power density and compromise the key advantage of supercapacitors. To help address this issue through material optimization, here we unravel the mechanisms of charging subnanometre pores with ionic liquids using molecular dynamics simulations, navigated by a phenomenological model. We show that charging of ionophilic pores is a diffusive process, often accompanied by overfilling followed by de-filling. In sharp contrast to conventional expectations, charging is fast because ion diffusion during charging can be an order of magnitude faster than in the bulk, and charging itself is accelerated by the onset of collective modes. Further acceleration can be achieved using ionophobic pores by eliminating overfilling/de-filling and thus leading to charging behaviour qualitatively different from that in conventional, ionophilic pores.},

  abstract      = {The discharge rate is critical to the performance of lithium/oxygen batteries: it impacts both cell capacity and discharge-phase morphology, and in so doing may also affect the efficiency of the oxygen-evolution reaction during recharging. First-discharge data from tens of Li/O2 cells discharged across four rates are analyzed statistically to inform these connections. In the practically significant superficial current-density range of 0.1 to 1 mA cm-2, capacity is found to fall as a power law, with a Peukert’s-law exponent of 1.6 ± 0.1. X-ray diffractometry confirms the dominant presence of crystalline Li2O2 in the discharged electrodes. A completely air-free sample-transfer technique was developed to implement scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the discharge product. SEM imaging of electrodes with near-average capacities provides statistically significant measures of the shape and size variation of electrodeposited Li2O2 particles with respect to discharge current. At lower rates, typical “toroidal” particles are observed that are well approximated as cylindrical structures, whose average radii remain relatively constant as discharge rate increases, whereas their average heights decrease. At the highest rate studied, air-free SEM shows that particles take needle-like shapes rather than forming the nanosheets or compact films described elsewhere. Average particle volumes decrease with current while particle surface-to-volume ratios increase dramatically, supporting the notion that Li2O2 grows by a locally mass-transfer-limited nucleation and growth mechanism.

  abstract  = {Although dominating the consumer electronics markets as the power source of choice for popular portable devices, the common lithium battery is not yet suited for use in sustainable electrified road transport. The development of advanced, higher-energy lithium batteries is essential in the rapid establishment of the electric car market. Owing to its exceptionally high energy potentiality, the lithium-air battery is a very appealing candidate for fulfilling this role. However, the performance of such batteries has been limited to only a few charge-discharge cycles with low rate capability. Here, by choosing a suitable stable electrolyte and appropriate cell design, we demonstrate a lithium-air battery capable of operating over many cycles with capacity and rate values as high as 5,000 mAh g(carbon)(-1) and 3 A g(carbon)(-1), respectively. For this battery we estimate an energy density value that is much higher than those offered by the currently available lithium-ion battery technology.},
